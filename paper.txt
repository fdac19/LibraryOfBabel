ABSTRACT
Codon usage patterns in the slime mould Dictyosteiium discoideum have been re-examined (a total
of 58 genes have been analysed). Considering the extreme A+T-richness of this genome
(G+C=22%), there is a surprising degree of codon usage variation among genes. For example,
G+C content at silent sites varies from less than 10% to greater than 30%. It was previously suggested
[Warrick, H.M. and Spudich, J.A. (1988) Nucleic Acids Res. 16: 6617-6635] that highly expressed
genes contain fewer 'optimal' codons than genes expressed at lower levels. However, it appears
that the optimal codons were misidentified. Multivariate statistical analysis shows that the greatest
variation among genes is in relative usage of a particular subset of codons (about one per amino
acid), many of which are C-ending. We have identified these as optimal codons, since (i) their
frequency is positively correlated with gene expression level, and (ii) there is a strong mutation bias
in this genome towards A and T nucleotides. Thus, codon usage in D.discoideum can be explained
by a balance between the forces of mutational bias and translational selection.

INTRODUCTION
The origins of codon usage patterns are thought to be understood for a variety of genomes
(1,2). For example, it is well established that highly expressed genes in both Escherichia
coli ( 3 - 5 ) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (6,7) have strongly biased usage of alternative
synonymous codons, and that the 'preferred' codons (which differ between the two species)
are those thought to be translated most efficiently and/or accurately by the most abundant
tRNAs in each species (1); lowly expressed genes in each species have less biased codon
usage patterns. These observations strongly suggest that natural selection has shaped the
pattern of codon usage in these two organisms but that, in genes under weak selection,
mutation bias also plays a role; i.e., the codon usage in any gene reflects a selection-mutation
balance (2,8,9). It is interesting to know how widespread this phenomenon is. Analyses
of codon usage in genes from certain other species, for example the gram-positive bacterium
Bacillus subtilis (10), the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (11), and the higher
eukaryote Drosophila melanogaster (12), are all indicative of codon selection. In some
other species it appears that mutational biases completely dominate codon usage: these
include (i) organisms with small effective population sizes (where possible codon selection
is overcome by random drift), such as mammals (13,14), and (ii) genomes with very skewed
base composition, either very A+T-rich such as Mycoplasma capricolum (15) and
Plasmodium falciparum (16,17), or very G + C-rich such as Micrococcus luteus (15).
Against this background, a recent analysis of codon usage in the slime mould
Dictyosteiium discoideum (18) has produced a unique and quite paradoxical result: 'optimal'

ANALYSES
Codon usage data
We first analysed codon usage frequencies in the same 47 genes as previously detailed
(18); the genes are listed in Table 1A. Where possible, gene sequences were taken from
GenBank (20) accessed under the ACNUC system (21). These codon usage values were
compared to those presented in Ref. 18; we found discrepancies in the data for 21 of the
47 genes. After consulting the original sequence publications, we conclude that more than
100 of the codon usage values presented in Tables 2, 3 and 4 of Ref. 18 are inaccurate,
although the only substantial errors concern the 'low M4 mRNA' (gene 3.9 in Ref. 18).
We have also added the 10 genes (one replacing a partial sequence) listed in Table IB,
for which sequences have since become available, as well as 2 plasmid genes (Table 1C).
The total codon frequencies in all 56 chromosomal genes are presented in Table 2.
Several indices of codon usage bias were calculated for each gene:
G+C = frequency of G+C in the entire gene
GC3s = frequency of G + C at silent third codon positions (i.e., Trp, Met and
termination codons are excluded)
chi/L = scaled chi-square, measuring general codon usage bias; calculated as
the chi-square for deviation from equal usage of synonymous codons, scaled by division
by the number of codons (excluding Trp, Met and termination codons)—see Ref. 12.
Fop = frequency of 'optimal' codons, measuring species-specific bias; we
have identified an 'optimal' codon (listed in Table 3; for justification see below) for each
of 15 amino acids—the Fop is calculated as the proportion of these 15 codons among all
49 codons for these amino acids (modified from the index devised by Ikemura—see Ref. 1).
All DNA sequence and/or codon usage data, as well as FORTRAN programmes to calculate
codon usage and these codon bias indices, are available on request; please send a floppy
disk formatted for an IBM-compatible microcomputer.
Table 1
Most genes are referred to by their product. Discoidin genes are given gene names: I-? is the 3' fragment of
gene I-beta or I-gamma' (designations from Ref. 18 are given in brackets).
The following statistics are given for each gene (see ANALYSES for more details): C+Cand GC3s, the G+C
content of the entire gene, and of silent third codon positions, respectively; chi/L a measure of nonspecific codon
usage bias; Fop the frequency of optima] codons; and L the number of codons, including Tcr (* indicates a partial
sequence).

codons have been identified, and the frequency of their use varies among genes, but genes
with the highest expression levels have the lowest frequency of these codons. The genome
of this organism is known to be very A+T-rich (19) and so mutational influences on codon
usage may be prevalent. This might explain the lack of a correlation between codon usage
and the level of gene expression. However, the finding of a negative correlation is so
surprising and difficult to rationalise, that we have investigated this problem further. Our
results suggest that more highly expressed genes do have higher frequencies of 'optimal'
codons, and thus that codon usage patterns in D.discoideum can be explained in the same
general framework as those in E.coli or yeast.

Table 2. Total codon frequencies in 56 Diayosteliwn discoideum genes.

Codon usage is summed over all genes in Table 1 (except the plasmid genes, and the partial alpha actinin sequence);
there are 17921 codons in total. Values given are numbers of occurrences, and relative synonymous codon usage
(RSCU-the observed number divided by the number expected if all codons for that amino acid are used equally).
* codons designated as 'favored' in Ref. 18 (see Table 3 for our 'optimal' codons).

Correspondence analysis
Correspondence analysis (22) is a method of multivariate analysis which has often been
used to investigate variation in codon usage patterns (e.g., Refs. 10,12,23). The method
has been described in detail elsewhere, and so we simply point out that the technique can
be used to identify the major trends (portrayed as successive, orthogonal axes) in codon
usage among genes. The positions of the 47 D.discoideum genes on the first plane produced
by correspondence analysis of codon usage are shown in Figure 1. Genes at opposite ends
of the first (horizontal) axis have the most different patterns of codon usage.
Genes have been presented in Table 1A in order of their appearance on the first axis
of the correspondence analyis (from left to right in Figure 1). The position of a gene on
the first axis is not significantly correlated with nonspecific codon usage bias, as measured
by chi/L (r = 0.17, p > 0.4). However, the position of a gene on the first axis is highly
correlated with the G + C content at silent sites (r = 0.75, p < < 0.001); genes to the
left of Figure 1 (at the top in Table la) have higher G + C content.
To discern the trend in codon usage along axis 1, we have tabulated the codon usage
in groups of 5 genes taken from each end of axis 1, and from the middle (Table 3). The
trend in silent site G+C content is seen particularly in the case of certain C-ending codons
(UUC, CUC, AUC, GUC, ACC, GCC, UAC, CAC and AAC) which are quite heavily
used in the genes at one end of axis 1 (the group labelled 'High' in Table 3), but are used
at much lower frequencies in genes from the other extreme (the 'Low' group).
The second (vertical) axis in Figure 1 seems to reflect variation among genes due to
amino acid composition. Genes producing homologous proteins have similar positions on
this axis. For example, the actin genes are spread over a narrow range on axis 2, with
the exception of the actin 3-subl and 3-sub2 genes which encode divergent actin-like

Figure 1. Correspondence analysis of codon usage in 47 Dictyostelium discoideum genes. Each point is a gene
plotted at its coordinates on the first two axes produced by the analysis (axis 1 is horizontal). Certain genes are
highlighted: these encode actins (black triangles), actin-like proteins (open triangles), discoidins (open squares),
ubiquitins (stars), myosin chains (black squares) and certain others (asterisks: RP = nbosomal protein, PK =
protein kinase, RAS = ras-homologue, EB4 and Dl 1 (see Table 1). The actin pseudogene (actin 2-sub2; see
Ref.26) is arrowed.

proteins. The discoidin genes are tightly grouped in Figure 1, but more so with respect
to axis 2 than axis 1. Two of the ubiquitin genes have similar amino acid compositions
and are close on axis 2; the third (ubiquitin 17) includes a nonubiquitin tail peptide. In
addition, correspondence analysis of relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU; see Table
2) values does not produce the separation seen on the second axis in Figure 1.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The total codon frequencies in 56 Dictyostelium discoideum genes are presented in Table
2. It can immediately be seen that codon usage is highly biased. Some codons (i.e., CUG,
CCC, CCG, ACG, GCG, CAG, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGG and GGG) are very rarely
used, although none are completely absent. There is a clear bias against G+C-rich codons,
reflecting the high A + T content of the genome as a whole. These general observations
were made several years ago, when the data set numbered 15 genes (24). However, as
in many other species, there is considerable codon usage variation among genes. Therefore,
as we have stressed previously for other species (2), the total codon frequencies (as in
Table 2) cannot be taken as a description of codon usage in this organism. Rather, it is
necessary to consider the range of codon usage patterns across genes (as in Table 3).
The principal conclusion for which we will argue is that the codon usage variation among
D.discoideum genes, as revealed by correspondence analysis and illustrated in Table 3,
reflects the different extents to which translational selection favouring certain optimal codons
(which are largely C-ending) overcomes mutational bias towards A and T nucleotides.
There are two, complementary, threads to our argument: first that, in the absence of
selection, the mutation bias of the D.discoideum genome produces very A+T-rich
sequences; second that the correspondence analysis has tended to discriminate among genes
with respect to their expected level of expression.

* 'optimal' codons

Mutational bias in D.discoideum
At 22% G+C, the genome of D.discoideum is among the most A+T-rich known. Since
at the first two codon positions (which are constrained to encode specific amino acids)
the average G+C content is 42%, other sites must be considerably more A+T-rich. In
prokaryotes, where there is little noncoding DNA, such extreme overall A+T-richness
can only occur if nearly all codons are A- or U-ending (15). Thus, it is very surprising
to find some genes in D.discoideum with G+C content at silent sites as high as 30%.
However, there appears to be a considerable amount of noncoding DNA in the D.discoideum

Figure 2. Codon usage bias and gene expression level. Each point is a gene (the symbols have the same meaning

level data).

genome (see below), and the G+C content of the noncoding DNA (introns and flanking
sequences) in the sequences known is around 16%.
Since noncoding DNA is under comparatively little constraint its base composition should
be indicative of the value (of G+C) towards which mutation biases will tend in the absence
of selection. Then we would suggest that the genes with GC3s values close to 16% (the
'Low' group in Table 3) may have little selected codon bias, but higher GC3s values reflect
increasing selective constraints on codon usage.
Codon usage and gene expression: analogy with yeast
While expression level data are available for only a few of the genes examined here, some
generalisations can probably be made. For example, in E.coli and yeast ribosomal protein
genes are among the most highly expressed and have a very high usage of species-specific
optimal codons (3-5,7). It is striking that the single ribosomal protein gene in the current
data set lies at one extreme along the major trend in codon usage variation (at the extreme
left in Figure 1); this is the G+C-rich end of the trend. Actin and ubiquitin genes in yeast
are also highly expressed (and highly biased); from Table 1 it can be seen that in
D.discoideum these genes are the most extreme after the ribosomal protein gene. On the
other hand, protein kinase genes and ras-homologues in both S.cerevisiae and S.pombe
are lowly expressed and have very low codon bias (7,11); among the D.discoideum genes
those encoding the protein kinase and the ras-homologue have the lowest GC3s values,
and have a codon usage pattern near the extreme opposite to the ribosomal protein gene
(Table 1, Figure 1). In S.cerevisiae monomeric ubiquitin genes have higher codon bias
than the polyubiquitin locus (25); among the D.discoideum ubiquitin genes, the monomeric
locus has the codon usage most similar to the ribosomal protein gene (Table 1, Figure 1).
Finally, it is also striking that the actin 2-sub2 locus, which is thought to be a pseudogene
(26), has a low GC3s and the right-most position (on axis 1) of all the actin genes. Any
codon bias due to translational selection would be expected to decay in a pseudogene.
Since actin 2-sub2 retains an intermediate level of bias it might be thought to be recently

inactivated; this is supported by the absence (within the partial sequence known) of any
internal stop codons.
'Optimal' codons in D.discoideum
From the above, it follows that 'optimal' D.discoideum codons might be identified as those
which occur at significandy higher frequencies in the highly expressed/G+C-rich genes
than in the lowly expressed/A +T-rich genes. Our candidate optimal codons for 15 amino
acids are indicated in Table 3. These include the 9 C-ending codons listed above, plus
AAG, and (interestingly) CGU, CCA, CAA, GAA and GGU. Thus, not all of the optimal
codons are G+C-rich, and GC3s may not be the most accurate representation of the trend
in codon usage. Indeed, the relative proportion of these optimal codons in a gene (Fop)
is more highly correlated with the gene's position on axis 1 (r = 0.94) than is GC3s.
Future increases in the data set may well reveal that CUC, UGC and GAC are the optimal
codons for the three other amino acids, but we have not included them in the current analysis
because their frequencies do not differ significandy between the current High and Low
groups.
Analyses of codon usage in E.coli, B.subtilis, S.cerevisiae, S.pombe and D.melanogaster
(reviewed in Ref.2) have revealed species-specific patterns of codon preference. However,
some codons (UUC, UAC, AUC, AAC, GAC and GGU) appear to be preferred in more
highly expressed genes in all these species. Five of these codons also appear among the
optimal codons we have just designated for D.discoideum (Table 3), while the sixth (GAC)
also appears to be favoured in the high expressed group.
There is comparatively little overlap between the set of optimal codons we have identified
and diose suggested previously by Warrick and Spudich (18). Their 18 'favored' codons
(see Table 2) include only one (GGU) of the 6 'universally optimal' codons listed above,
and only 5 of our optimal set (CCA, CAA, GAA, CGU and GGU). This arises because
Warrick and Spudich identified 'favored' codons as those appearing most frequently in
their total data set. Since codon usage patterns vary greatly among genes even from one
genome (1,2), this approach is susceptible to error unless the genes compiled in the data
set are predominantly those in which codon selection is most effective. More precisely,
this approach does not discriminate between mutation bias and codon selection as causes
of the codon frequencies; because the mutation bias (to A+T-richness) is so strong in
this genome all of the most frequently used codons are A- or U-ending. We conclude that
optimal D.discoideum codons were previously misidentified (18).
Gene expression and codon usage in D.discoideum
Above we argued that the correspondence analysis had revealed a trend in codon usage
related to gene expression level, but our information on the latter came by analogy with
other species. Now we use data from D.discoideum to examine the relationship between
gene expression level and frequency of use of the optimal codons identified in the preceding
section.
We have derived approximate expression levels (exp) for 18 genes, as follows. Actins
comprise about 9% of total cell protein in vegetative cells (27) and data are available for
the percentage of total actin RNA attributable to each of 10 of the loci studied here (26);
e.g., actin 8 is the most abundantly expressed gene, accounting for 23% of actin RNA
(exp = 2.1 %). Myosin comprises at least 0.5% of total cell protein (28); the two sequenced
genes each contribute two subunits per myosin hexamer (exp = 0.17%). Discoidin I
comprises about 1 % of total cell protein during aggregate formation (29); the NC-4 strain
has only three discoidin loci, all of which are expressed (exp = 0.33%)—the other two

between the frequencies of T in codon position 1 and position 3 ( R = A o r G ; Y = C o r T).

loci appear to have resulted from a recent duplication in the Ax-3L strain (we plot only
the two complete sequences in Figure 2). Severin comprises (exp =) 0.2% of total cell
protein (30), the contact site A protein approximately 0.1% (31), and calmodulin 0.04%
(32). The M4 messenger represents about 0.01 % of total mRNA in vegetative cells (33).
These exp values are clearly very approximate and may only apply to certain stages of
development. Nevertheless, they may serve to indicate the relative expression levels of
different genes. Warrick and Spudich (18) cited expression level data for 6 of these genes;
some of our values appear to differ.
In Figure 2 we present a plot of Fop against expression level (exp, on a log scale)—
among these genes there is a clear positive correlation between these two variables (r =
0.63; P = 0.004). In particular, the highest Fop value is found in the most highly expressed
actin gene (actin 8), while the lowest value is found in the most lowly expressed mRNA,
M4. The statistical significance of this correlation relies on these two outlying points, but
the potential for inaccuracy among the exp values should be remembered. If only the 10
actin genes (for which the relative expression levels may be more strictly comparable)
are considered the correlation is slightly stronger (r = 0.71; P = 0.02).
Among the additional genes in Table IB, that encoding AdoHcy hydrolase has a very
high Fop value, and so we would predict that it is a highly expressed gene. This would
appear to be true, since it is reported that AdoHcy hydrolase may comprise about 2%
of total soluble protein (34).
The two plasm id genes (Table 1C) appear to have poorly adapted codon usage, as seen
in E.coli plasmid genes (4). In fact, their codon usage is quite unusual. For example, in
the pDGl ORF alone there are as many (or more) occurrences of CUG, ACG, CGC,
AGG and GGG as in the total of 56 chromosoaml genes (Table 2). The D5 gene is also
unusual (see below).
We have found no differentiation among genes (with respect to codon usage) that can
be related to the developmental stage at which the gene is predominantly expressed.
However, as discussed previously (18), there is no indication that tRNA levels change
during development.
Genome structure
Assuming that the current database is typical of the D.discoideum genome, and noting
the difference in G+C content between genes and the genome as a whole, it is possible

genes.

CONCLUSIONS
In both E.coli and yeast, the frequency of 'optimal' codons in a gene is positively correlated
with the level of gene expression (1-9). In Dictyostelium discoideum, however, it has
been reported that 'higher levels of expression correlate with lower frequency use of favored
codons' (18). As those authors point out, this is 'an unusual pattern which is not consistent
with conventional explanations'. In fact, the 'favored codons' under discussion appear to
be those favoured by mutational bias. Highly nonrandom codon usage can be generated
by mutation bias alone, so that high values of a general codon bias measure do not
necessarily indicate the action of translational selection. We have identified the codons
which appear to be optimal with respect to translation, and find that higher levels of
expression do correlate with higher frequency use of optimal codons.

(following Ref.23) to estimate the fraction of the genome which is coding. Thus, given
that the average G+C contents for the genome as a whole, genes, and noncoding sequences
are 22%, 35% and 16%, respectively, then coding sequences are likely to comprise
approximately 1/3 of the genome. It has been reported that intergenic regions are
comparatively short (35).
The D.discoideum genome has been estimated to be about 50 Mbp in length (17). The
average length of a gene (from Table 1) is about 1000 bp, implying that there may be
around 17,000 genes in total.
The difference in base composition between genes and noncoding DNA makes the
identification of protein—coding open reading frames comparatively easy. In addition, from
the current database it is possible to identify certain codon position nucleotide frequency
statistics which are diagnostoic of D.discoideum genes (Table 4). For example, all 56 genes
have an excess of purines at the first codon position (Rl—Yl is always positive). This
can be divided into two uncorrelated trends, i.e., an excess of G over C and an excess
of A over T. In the third codon position there is an excess of pyrimidines in all but 4
genes. (Note that these trends can be independent of G+C content.) Nucleotide frequencies
also vary between codon positions: Gl > G2 > G3, while T3 > Tl. These 'rules' all
apply to at least 90% of the D.discoideum genes examined; where these statistics are
uncorrelated they may be used as independent tests of the probability that an ORF is a
gene. (Several of these trends have previously been reported in other species, and so may
be of general utility.)
Interestingly, the D5 plasmid gene (Table 1C) has two base composition statistics lying
outside the range of those for nuclear genes: Y 3 - R 3 = - 1 6 % and G 2 - G 3 = - 7 % .

INTRODUCTION
The genetic code is degenerate, but synonymous
codons are rarely used in equal frequencies. The
pattern of codon usage in any gene must reflect
the joint actions of mutation biases, natural selection. and genetic d r i f ~ ~ . 'The
~ . ' ~selective factors
determining codon frequencies have been most
but
clearly elucidated in Escherichiu cofi,2.'o*26
among eukaryotes. Succharomjces cerrvisiue is the
organism in which codon usage is best understood.
Holland and Holland'' first noted the extremely high codon bias in a S. cerevisiue gene
encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatedehydrogenase. Bennetzen and Hall3 extended this observation
to the genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenase I and
enolase. which are also glycolytic enzymes. These
very highly expressed genes use, almost exclusively,
just 25 of the 61 sense codons. It was suggested that
these 25 codons are those best translated by the
major t RNA species, and this was substantiated by
the evidence of Ikemura."' In contrast, in genes
expressed at lower levels all 61 sense codons are
utilired, and codon usage is generally less biased.

By 1986 it was possible to surve codon usage in
more than 100 S. cerevisiue genes.2T Our analyses at
that time confirmed the relationship between codon
usage bias and gene expression level that had been
observed with smaller data sets. A large group of
genes with high codon usage bias was identified.
comprising largely ribosomal proteins and glycolytic enzymes. The difference in codon usage
between these highly expressed genes and others was
sufficient that yeast genes appeared to fall into two
distinct
In the last 5 years, there has been intense activity
in yeast molecular genetics, including the sequencing of very many genes, and culminating recently in
the launching of a project to sequence the entire
genome of S. cerevisiue. It seems an opportune
moment to review codon usage in the more than 500
S. cerevisiue gene sequences now available.
BIOLOGICAL BASES OF PREFERENTIAL
CODON USAGE
I t is important to review briefly the basic factors
influencing codon usage, since misconceptions
abound. As already noted, it seemsclear that certain
codons are 'optimal' for the translation system in a
particular organism. These are the codons recognized most efficiently by the most abundantly available tRNA species. (As the anticodon sequences and
relative abundances of different tRNAs vary among
species, so do the optimal codons.) As a corollary,
certain codons appear to be particularly disadvantageous ('non-optimal') and are characterized by
their rarity in highly expressed genes.
It has often been suggested that the codon usage
in a gene may be an important factor directly
influencing the expression level of that gene, and
that consequently natural selection would favour
the presence of some non-optimal codons in genes
expressed at low levels. The pattern of codon usage
in any gene would reflect selection for a particular

658

P. M. SHARP AND E. C O W

distribution of optimal and non-optimal codons, to
produce a certain level of expression. For several
reasons, this is not likely to be an accurate description of the basis of codon preference.26Codons are
translated at different rates, but under most circumstances the rate of polypeptide chain elongation is
not likely to affect the rate of gene expression, which
is more likely to be determined by the rate of initiation of translation. However, the rate of polypeptide chain elongation will influence the efficiency
with which ribosomes are utilized,” and thus can
affect the growth rate of the cell. This could be the
basis of a selective advantage for optimal codons,
which would be most pronounced in the genes most
highly expressed at times of rapid growth (for a
recent review, see Andersson and Kurland’). It
should be noted that quite high level expression of
heterologous genes with apparently poorly adapted
codon usage has often been observed. Also, of
course, other complex mechanisms exist which
determine gene expression levels.’*
A rather simpler explanation of codon usage
arises from a consideration of population genetics
theory. First, it should be stressed that codon usage
in the absence of any selection will reflect the
underlying mutational biases of the genome. At the
simplest level, these biases may tend towards A + Tor G +C-richness, although the particular pattern
of mutation at a single site can also be influenced by
the neighbouring nucleotides. Thus, the ‘null
hypothesis’ that is often considered when examining
codon usage, i.e., equal use of different synonyms, is
in fact only expected when mutation patterns are
unbiased. The S . cerevisiae genome is A T-rich:
overall base composition is around 3 9 4 0 % G + C,
and the G + C content at third codon positions in
‘lowly expressed’ genes was found to be close to this
value (38%).29
Any selection pressures associated with translational differences among synonyms are superimposed upon thismutational bias. The samecodons
are favoured in allgenes, but the strengthofselection,
and thus the extent to which the codon usage of a
particular gene deviates from the mutational bias,
depends on the level of gene expression. The presence
of a number of non-optimal codons in a gene
expressed at low levels then reflects the relative
ineffectiveness of selection against them.
Again from population genetics theory, it is clear
that the long-term evolutionary effective population
size of the species is also important in determining
the efficacy of selection, but this factor is the same
for all genes in a single genome.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae PROTEIN-CODING
GENE SEQUENCE DATABASE

We have collated gene sequence data for 575 genes.
Protein-coding sequences were extracted from the
GenBank/EMBL DNA sequence data library
(release 66) using the ACNUC retrieval system.”
Incomplete genes of less than 50 codons have been
excluded. Genes from strains of Saccharomyces
other than S. cerevisiae have been included, since
their codon usage is likely to be very similar.
Mitochondrial, plasmid and transposable element
genes have been excluded, since their codon usage
can be quite different from true chromosomal genes.
Several sets of similar genes were identified,
and subsequently treated in one of two ways: (i)
sequences which appear to be multiple copies of the
same (‘identical’) gene are represented in the data set
once, even if the sequences were not identical (the
differences being attributed to sequencing errors,
or allelic polymorphism), and (ii) sequences which
appear to be different members of a multigene
family were all retained, even if the sequences
(within the protein-coding region) were identical.
Mosse et a1.22listed 400 genes in December 1988,
including some multiple copies of genes which
appear to be allelic, as well as a small number of
sequences from Candida and Schizosaccharomyces.
The 575 genes are listed in alphabetical order in
Table 1, with an abbreviated literature reference,
and the GenBank/EMBL accession number. The
chromosomal location of each gene (where known),
and its length in codons, are also given. These
sequences total more than 850 kb, or more than 5%
of the complete S. cerevisiae genome.
CODON USAGE IN S. cerevisiae
The overall usage of codons in the 575 genes is presented in Table 2. Codons evident1 differ substantially in frequency. Arnold et al.Y detailed the
trinucleotide frequencies in almost 400 kb of S .
cerevisiae DNA sequence data. A substantial part of
those sequences were not protein-coding, and all
three frames through a coding sequence were considered, so that codons contribute to, but do not
determine, the trinucleotide frequencies. There are
similarities in these data sets, but also interesting
differences. For example, A T-rich sequences are
generally common in both data sets, but both TTT
and ATA are much more common as trinucleotides
(ranking second and ninth, respectively) than as
codons. G C-rich trinucleotides are the eight least

+

+

659

SYNONYMOUS CODON USAGE IN SACCHAROMYC’ES CEREVISIAE

common, and GCC is much more frequent in the
codon data.
Unequal usage of codons is partly due to unequal
usage of different amino acids; the overall amino
acid composition of these 575 gene products is presented in Table 3. These composition values are not
dissimilar to those derived from the entire PIR protein sequence databank. However, it is noticeable
that those amino acids encoded by A+T-rich
codons (Phe, Tyr, Ile, Asn and Lys) all occur at
higher frequencies in the yeast proteins than in the
general databank. Also, those encoded by G + C rich codons (Pro, Arg, Ala and Gly) all occur at
lower frequencies in yeast. This suggests that the
overall mutation bias towards A T-richness has at
least a small effect on yeast protein composition.
To clarify patterns of synonymous codon usage,
thc relativc use of alternative synonyms is presented
as the ratio of the observed value to the average for
that amino acid -the ‘relative synonymous codon
usage’ (RSCU). The important point made by
Bennetzen and Hall3, which a pears to be generalizcable to most organi~ms,’~.~?s
that codon usage
varies greatly among genes within the genome. In
most unicellular species, there is a single major trend
among genes, which can be identified by multivariate statistical analysis; correspondence analysis,
first used in this context by Grantham et uf.,” has
becn the method of choice for codon usage data.
Genes at one end of this major trend exhibit a very
strong preference for the particular codons which
are optimal in that species, while genes at the other
extreme have codon usage more greatly influenced
by mutational bias (see above).
To illustrate the codon usage heterogeneity in S.
cerevisiue, the codon usage values for groups of
genes at the two extremes of the major trend are
presented in Table 4. As previously noted, the high
bias genes are the highly expressed genes. In Table 4,
22 optimal codons have been identified as those
occurring at significantly higher frequencies in the
highly expressed genes. These codons are almost
identical to thosc identified by Bennetzen and Hall3
using a very small number of genes: the only differences concern GCC (Ala) and GAC (Asp). GCC
was considered optimal by Bennetzen and Hall,
because it is quite common in very highly expressed
genes, but its relative frequency does not differ significantly between the high and low groups in Table
4. Bennetzen and Hall considered that, although
GAC was more prevalent than GAU in the genes
they examined, its frequency was not high enough to
justify identification as an optimal codon; in Table 4

+

the increase in frequency of GAC in the highly
expressed genes is comparatively small, but highly
significant.
The selective disadvantage of the presence of
certain non-optimal codons in these highly
expressed genes must be quite severe. Even though
30 genes have been used to generate the ‘high’ data
set in Table 4, there are seven sense codons which
are never used, and another five which appear only
once. All of these codons can be translated in S.
cerevisiae because they are quite common in the
total data set (Table 2).
In the lowly biased (and lowly expressed) genes,
codon usage is much more uniform (RSCU values
are close to 1.0). For some amino acids, the bias is
not merely reduced (by comparison with the high
genes) but also reversed; these are amino acids (such
as Phe, Tyr or His) where the optimal codon is C- or
G-ending, and in the lowly expressed genes a T- or
A-ending codon becomes more prevalent. In other
cases, notably Gln and Glu, where the A-ending
codon is optimal, this codon remains the more frequent in the lowly expressed genes. In all of these
cases, and indeed extensively across the genetic
code, the T- and A-ending codons occur at frequencies a little higher than average (RSCU values
around 1.1) in these lowly expressed genes. It is not
necessary to invoke selection for the presence of
these non-optimal codons in lowly expressed genes,
and indeed it is not obvious that such selection
would produce such a uniform pattern of codon
usage. Rather, these observations are quite consistent with the A T-rich mutation bias ofthe yeast
genome described earlier. Interestingly, Bulmer6has
recently shown that codon usage in S. cerevisiue
genes with low codon bias shows a context effect
consistent with mutation biases which aredependent
on neighbouring bases.
Frequency differences between the highly and
lowly ex ressed genes are not restricted to sense
codons.2 Highly expressed genes almost exclusively
terminate with the ochre codon (UAA), while in
lowly expressed genes the amber (UAG) and opal
(UGA) codons are equally likely to be used (Table
4). This observation suggests a selective advantage associated with using UAA, but the possible
mechanism of this is unknown.

Collins and Coulson.

subset of 25 codons, Wright32 has developed a
simple measure of codon usage bias, the ‘effective
number of codons’, N,, used in a gene. N, is
analogous to the ‘effective number of alleles’
measure used in population genetics, and gives
the number of equally used codons which would
generate the same codon usage bias as observed.
To calculate N,, first define S, the sum of the
squared codon frequencies, for each of the 18 amino
acids where there is a choice among synonymous
codons

s = z (n,,n,)?

(1)

where n, is the number of occurrences of the ith
codon, and n, the total number of codons, for this
amino acid; the summation is performed over the k

alternative synonyms. Now, for each amino acid,
define E

F = (Sn,- I)/(n,

- 1)

(2)

Then, the N, value for a gene is
N, = 2 + (9/F,) + (WJ+ WF4) + ( 3 F J
(3)
where Fk is the average of the F values for the
amino acids with k-fold degeneracy. N, measures
general codon bias, i.e., deviation from equal use of
synonyms, in such a way that lower values indicate
stronger bias. Thus, a gene utilizing only one codon
per amino acid has the strongest bias, and the minimum value for this index, i.e., N, of 20; a gene using
all codons equally has a value of 61. (In fact, the
calculated value may exceed 61.0, if codon usage is

Codon bias index (CBI)

The codon bias index, CBI, is a measure of directional codon bias suggested by Bennetzen and

The CBI measures the extent to which a gene uses
the particular codons which appear to be ‘optimal’
in S. cerevisiue. These authors designated 22 ‘ideal’
codons (for 17 amino acids) as those comprising
more than 85% of the codons used for an amino
acid in the ADH-I and G3PDH genes. (These 22
codons are identical to the optimal codons in Table

Codon adaptation index (CAI)

The Codon Adaptation Index, CAI, was proposed
by Sharp and Li.” The CAI is another measure of
directional codon usage bias, and can be viewed as a
modification of ‘proportion of optimal codons’
measures (like the CBI). A ‘fitness’ or ‘relative
adaptedness’ value, w , for each codon is estimated
from its relative frequency ofuse in a reference set of
very highly expressed genes. (Of the 24 genes used in
the reference set, 16 encode ribosomal proteins, one
encodes an elongation factor, and seven encode
glycolytic enzymes.) The CAI for a gene is then
defined as the average of the w values for each of
the codons in that gene; the ‘average’ used is the
geometric mean, which is best calculated using a
logarithmic approach, so that

scaling factor. In a gene with extreme codon usage

APPLICATIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
Codon usage and heterologous gene expression

The potential influence of codon usage on heterologous gene expression in yeast has been of wide
interest, but has been quite controversial.* For the
reasons discussed above (see ‘Biological bases of
preferential codon usage’), codon usage is not often
likely to prevent a high level of gene expression.
Experimental observations are often difficult to
intrepret because changes in codon usage may also
affect mRNA structures. Results have been mixed.
For example, Ernst and Kawashima’ constructed
eight synthetic genes (differing only at silent sites)
encoding alpha-factor/somatomedin-C fusions with
CBI values ranging from 0.13 to 0.80, but found no
correlation between the degree of codon usage bias
and the level of gene expression. In contrast,
Hoekema et all4 took the S. cerevisiae PGKI gene,
which has a very high codon bias (Table l), and
progressively replaced up to 39% of optimal codons
with non-optimal synonyms; they reported a dramatic decline in expression level. Hoekema et al.
also reported a decline in mRNA level which may
indicate an indirect effect of codon usage on expression level by reducing mRNA stability,
although it has also been pointed out that the region
of the gene mutagenized is thought to contain a
transcriptional a ~ t i v a t o r . ~
There may be a general relationship between
codon usage and mRNA stability. Herrick et ~ 1 .
characterized the mRNA decay rates for 15 genes
and noted that, among these genes, there is a negative correlation between the percentage of rare (i.e.,
non-optimal) codons and the mRNA half-life.
More precisely, three mRNAs with particularly
long half-lives all had few non-optimal codons.
However, five other mRNAs with comparably low
frequencies of non-optimal codons had much
shorter half-lives. Furthermore, a correlation does
not indicate causation. Obviously, highly expressed
genes will have been subject to selection against
non-optimal codons, as well as for any (perhaps
quite separate) features which increase mRNA
stability.
Codon usage might affect protein production in a
quite different manner. It has been suggested that it
may be advantageous to have clusters of rare
codons, which might cause ribosome pausing, at
sites within mRNAs correspondin to domain

revealed that the apparent cluster of rare codons
was an artefact of sequencing errors. Nevertheless,
these authors” have suggested that significant
clusters of rare codons in other yeast mRNAs may
have this function.
Codon usage and gene detection

A variety of methods have been proposed for the
detection of protein-coding open reading frames
within anonymous DNA sequences (reviewed by
von Heijne”). The most efficient methods generally
utilize information derived from known genes, and
one such piece of information is codon usage. The
overall A+T-richness of yeast DNA reduces the
probability that open reading frames occur by
chance, so that any open reading frame of more
than, say, 50 codons is likely to be protein-coding.
(In a random DNA sequence of 40% G + C , the
probability of none of 50 codons being a termination
codon is less than 5%; in DNA of 50% G + C the
probability is nearly lo%.) However, these methods
can also be used to detect areas of sequence in which
errors may be present-with hindsight, it is possible
to see that the cluster of otherwise rare codons in the
PYKl gene (which has generally high codon usage
bias) signalled a sequencing error.”
Evolutionary considerations
’ ~ Codon usage patterns in very closely related
organisms are similar, for the somewhat trivial
reason that an insufficient number of nucleotide
substitutions have occurred for a difference in
codon usage to become apparent. However, a lack
of divergence in the biological parameters responsible for shaping codon usage may constrain codon
usage to be similar in more distantly related organisms. That is, the underlying mutation biases, as well
as the tRNA pools, may be similar. Thus, the general observations about codon usage in S. cerevisiue
seem to apply to Kluyveromyces lactis, even though
silent sites in these genes are potentially saturated
with changes.
Some differences from S. cerevisiaein codon usage
are found in the more distantly related ascomycete
fungi Neurospora crassa” and Aspergillus nidulans
(A. T. Lloyd and P. M. Sharp, in preparation). As
might be expected, codon usage in the very distantly
related fission east Schizosaccharomyces pomhe is
also divergent. Z.30

Finally, it is interesting to note that the extraordinarily high codon usage bias observed in certain

677

highly expressed yeast genes indicates that natural
selection can be both very strong and effective in
determining codon usage in this species. This may
lead to inferences both about the nature of the
selective forces to which S. cerevisiue has been
exposed, and also the long-term evolutionary
effective population size of this species.

Abstract
The role of adaptation is a fundamental question in molecular evolution. Theory predicts that species with large effective
population sizes should undergo a higher rate of adaptive evolution than species with low effective population sizes if
adaptation is limited by the supply of mutations. Previous analyses have appeared to support this conjecture because estimates
of the proportion of nonsynonymous substitutions fixed by adaptive evolution, a, tend to be higher in species with large Ne.
However, a is a function of both the number of advantageous and effectively neutral substitutions, either of which might
depend on Ne. Here, we investigate the relationship between Ne and xa, the rate of adaptive evolution relative to the rate of
neutral evolution, using nucleotide polymorphism and divergence data from 13 independent pairs of eukaryotic species. We
find a highly significant positive correlation between xa and Ne. We also find some evidence that the rate of adaptive evolution
varies between groups of organisms for a given Ne. The correlation between xa and Ne does not appear to be an artifact of
demographic change or selection on synonymous codon use. Our results suggest that adaptation is to some extent limited by
the supply of mutations and that at least some adaptation depends on newly occurring mutations rather than on standing
genetic variation. Finally, we show that the proportion of nearly neutral nonadaptive substitutions declines with increasing Ne.
The low rate of adaptive evolution and the high proportion of effectively neutral substitution in species with small Ne are
expected to combine to make it difficult to detect adaptive molecular evolution in species with small Ne.
Key words: adaptive evolution, effective population size, eukaryotes.

Introduction
Population genetic theory predicts that the effective population size (Ne) of a species should be a major determinant of
the rate of adaptive evolution if adaptive evolution is limited
by the supply of new mutations. There are two reasons for
this. First, the rate of adaptive evolution is expected to
be proportional to Nes if Ne s[1, where s is the strength
of selection. This is because the fixation probability of
a new advantageous mutation is proportional to Nes/N,
where N is the census population size, if Ne s[1 and s
is small (Kimura 1983), and the rate at which new advantageous mutations occur is Nu; hence, the rate of adaptive evolution is expected to be proportional to Nu  Nes/N 5 uNes.
Second, in large populations, a higher proportion of mutations are expected to be effectively selected because a higher
proportion are expected to have Ne s[1. Previous analyses
have suggested that the proportion of adaptive substitutions
(a) is correlated to the effective population size because there

is evidence of widespread adaptive amino acid substitutions
in species such as Drosophila, house mice, bacteria, and some
plant species with large Ne (Bustamante et al. 2002; Smith and
Eyre-Walker 2002; Sawyer et al. 2003; Bierne and Eyre-Walker
2004; Charlesworth and Eyre-Walker 2006; Haddrill et al.
2010; Ingvarsson 2010; Slotte et al. 2010; Strasburg et al.
2011), whereas there is little evidence in hominids and other
plant species that appear to have small Ne (Chimpanzee
Sequencing and Analysis Consortium 2005; Zhang and Li
2005; Boyko et al. 2008; Eyre-Walker and Keightley 2009;
Gossmann et al. 2010). There are, however, some exceptions.
Maize, for example, has a relatively large effective population
size, approaching that of wild house mice, but shows little
evidence of adaptive protein evolution (Gossmann et al.
2010), and the yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus, which presumably has a very large Ne, also shows little evidence of adaptive protein evolution (Liti et al. 2009). Furthermore, Drosophila
simulans does not appear to have undergone more adaptive

evolution than D. melanogaster, even though it is thought to
have a larger Ne (Andolfatto et al. 2011).
However, the correlation between a and Ne might be
misleading because a depends on the rate of effectively
neutral and advantageous substitution, variation in either
of which could be caused by Ne (Gossmann et al. 2010),
that is, a 5 Dadaptive/(Dadaptive þ Dnonadaptive) where Dadaptive
and Dnonadaptive are the rates of adaptive and nonadaptive
substitutions, respectively. There is evidence that the proportion of effectively neutral mutations is negatively correlated to Ne across many species (Popadin et al. 2007;
Piganeau and Eyre-Walker 2009), so a positive correlation
between a and Ne might be entirely explained by variation
in the number of effectively neutral substitutions. As a consequence, it has been suggested that xa, the rate of adaptive
substitution relative to the rate of neutral evolution is a more
appropriate measure of adaptive evolution for the purpose of
comparison between genomic regions or species (Gossmann
et al. 2010, see also Bierne and Eyre-Walker 2004; Obbard
et al. 2009), that is, xa 5 Dadaptive/Dneutral where Dneutral is
the substitution rate at sites that evolve neutrally. Contrary
to expectation, Gossmann et al. (2010) failed to find any
evidence of a correlation between xa and Ne in plants; but
many of the plant species they considered appeared to have
low Ne, and there may have been insufficient information
from species with larger Ne to reveal a significant positive
correlation. In contrast, Strasburg et al. (2011) have recently
reported a significant positive correlation between xa and Ne
within sunflowers, including some species that have very
large Ne. There are two interpretations of a positive correlation between xa and Ne in sunflowers. First, the correlation could be due to a higher rate of adaptive substitution,
or second, it could be due to an artifact of population size
change (Strasburg et al. 2011). It has long been known
that approaches to estimate adaptive evolution by methods related to the MK test are sensitive to changes in Ne, if
there are slightly deleterious mutations (McDonald and
Kreitman 1991; Eyre-Walker 2002; Eyre-Walker and
Keightley 2009). For example, if the population has recently
expanded, then xa and a will tend to be overestimated
because slightly deleterious mutations, which would have
become fixed in the past when the population size was
small, no longer segregate as polymorphisms. This bias
might be a particular problem in the sunflower data set
because each species was contrasted against a common
outgroup species, so that each comparison shared much
of its divergence with all other comparisons. Therefore,
any differences in Ne between the species must have
occurred since they split and may have caused a genuine
or an artifactual increase in xa. It is difficult to differentiate
between these effects.
In contrast to the pattern in sunflowers, Jensen and
Bachtrog (2011) recently estimated the rate adaptive evolution in D. pseudoobscura and D. miranda; they estimated that

the two species probably had similar ancestral population
sizes but that D. miranda had gone through a recent severe
bottleneck. Despite this, the estimate of a along the two
lineages was quite similar.
It is also evident that estimates of a or xa and Ne are not
independent because Ne is usually estimated from the
neutral diversity, which is also used to estimate a or xa.
Sampling variation will therefore tend to induce a positive
correlation between estimates of adaptive evolution and
effective population size. This can be dealt with by randomly splitting the neutral sites into two halves, one of
which is used to estimate Ne and the other to estimate
the rate of adaptive evolution (Piganeau and Eyre-Walker
2009; Stoletzki and Eyre-Walker 2011). This correction is
accurate whether or not the sites are linked (Piganeau and
Eyre-Walker 2009).

Materials and Methods
Preparation of Data
Polymorphism data were retrieved from GenBank http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank or in case of Arabidopsis
thaliana downloaded from http://walnut.usc.edu/2010.
A summary of the analyzed data sets is shown in table 1.
Phylogenetic trees for the plant and Drosophila species used
in our analysis are given in supplementary figures S1 and S2
(Supplementary Material online), respectively (Drosophila 12
Genomes Consortium et al. 2007; Tang et al. 2008; Stevens
2010). Sequences were aligned using ClustalW using default
parameter values (Thompson et al. 1994). Coding regions
were assigned using protein-coding genomic data coordinates
or, if given, derived from the information in the GenBank input
files. An outgroup was assigned using the best Blast (Altschul
et al. 1990) hit against the outgroup genome or, if included,
taken from the GenBank Popset database (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/popset). For all analyses, synonymous sites
served as the neutral standard. Because some loci had been
sampled in more individuals than others and other loci had
missing data, we obtained the site frequency spectra
(SFS) for each number of chromosomes for each species
(e.g., we obtained the SFS for those sites with 4, 5, . . .
etc. chromosomes separately). As a consequence, there
was usually more than one SFS and its associated divergence
data for each species. The estimation of the distribution of
fitness effects (DFE), and xa was done jointly using all available SFS and divergence data for a given species. Summary
statistics, such as p, were calculated as weighted averages.
The numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous sites
and substitutions were computed using the F34 model
implemented in PAML (Yang 1997) in which codon frequencies are estimated from the nucleotide frequencies
at the three codon positions.
It is important in this type of analysis to count the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous sites correctly

and consistently across the divergence and polymorphism
data. It is appropriate to use a ‘‘mutational opportunity’’
definition of a site (Bierne and Eyre-Walker 2003) since we
are interested in the relative numbers of mutations that
can potentially occur at synonymous and nonsynonymous
sites. PAML provides estimates of the proportion of sites
that are nonsynonymous (and hence also synonymous)
from the divergence data, and these were used to calculate the number of nonsynonymous and synonymous sites
for the polymorphism data.

We assumed that synonymous sites were neutral, except
when we estimated the strength of selection on synonymous mutations (see below). We estimated Ne from the level

the literature, since

We estimated the mutation rate per generation in Populus
tremula in the following manner. Tuskan et al. (2006) note
that sequence divergence in putatively neutral sequences
is approximately six times slower in P. tremula than in
A. thaliana and that the average generation time for
P. tremula is 15 years. We therefore estimated the
mutation rate per generation in P. tremula by multiplying
the mutation rate estimated in A. thaliana from mutation
accumulation lines by 15/6 5 1.75  108.
The DFE and xa, the rate of adaptive substitutions relative
to the rate of synonymous substitutions (Gossmann et al.
2010), were estimated using a modified version of the
method of Eyre-Walker and Keightley (2009). First, the
DFE and demographic parameters of the population are

where dn and ds are the rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution, respectively. The method of EyreWalker and Keightley (2009) does not take into account
the fact that some substitutions between species are polymorphisms. This was taken into account in the following
manner (Keightley and Eyre-Walker 2012). The Keightley
and Eyre-Walker (2007) method estimates the DFE and
demographic parameters by generating vectors representing
the allele frequency distributions for synonymous and nonsynonymous sites by a transition matrix approach and using
these to calculate the likelihood of the observed SFS. Let
the density of mutations at i of 2N copies be vn(i) and vs(i)
for nonsynonymous and synonymous sites, respectively,
and let us assume that we have sampled a single sequence
from each species to estimate the divergence. The contribution of polymorphisms to apparent divergence is therefore

We also estimated xa using a model in which there was
negative selection upon synonymous mutations. We assume
that all synonymous mutations are subject to the same
strength of selection. Unfortunately, it is not possible to simultaneously estimate the demographic parameters and the
strength of selection on synonymous mutations unless
one includes information about which codons are preferred by selection (Zeng and Charlesworth 2009), and this
is not known for most of the species in our analysis. We
therefore infer the strength of selection at synonymous
sites from the SFS using the transition matrix approach
described in Keightley and Eyre-Walker (2007) assuming
a constant population size. The strength of selection at synonymous sites allows us to calculate the probability of fixation of synonymous mutations fs and obtain a corrected

where Pn and Ps are the numbers of nonsynonymous and

Creation of Independent Data Sets
Estimates of xa and Ne are not independent because they
both depend on neutral diversity, so sampling error will tend
to induce a positive correlation between Ne and xa. We
avoided this problem by splitting the synonymous site data
into two independent sets (which is similar to splitting the
data set into odd and even codons as in Smith and EyreWalker 2002; Piganeau and Eyre-Walker 2009; Stoletzki
and Eyre-Walker 2011) by generating a random multivariate
hypergeometric variable as follows:

ð7Þ

It is also necessary to adjust our estimate of Ne to take into
account the action of natural selection at synonymous sites.
This was performed in one of two ways, depending upon
whether our estimate of the mutation rate was a direct
estimate from a pedigree or mutation accumulation experiment, as in the Drosophila species, Arabidopsis, Capsella,
Populus, and Saccharomyces, or indirectly from phylogenetic
analysis, as in Mus, Helianthus, Oryza, Schieda, and Zea.
Kimura (1969) showed that the nucleotide diversity at a site

of strength s (positive s for advantageous mutations), relative
to that at a neutral site is

strength of selection acting at synonymous sites; for those
species in which the mutation rate came from a phylogenetic
analysis, we corrected for selection at synonymous sites
by multiplying the estimates by Q(S)/H(S). Synonymous
codon bias was measured using the effective number
of codons (ENC; Wright 1990) and ENC taking into account base composition bias (ENC#; Novembre 2002).
To investigate whether the proportion of effectively neutral
nonsynonymous mutations was correlated to Ne, we calculated a variant on the w statistic suggested by Piganeau
and Eyre-Walker (2009):

where Ls is the number of sites and P a vector consisting of
the number of nonmutated sites and the site frequency

spectrum so that P 5 Ls. We use Ps1 and Ps2 to compute
two corresponding independent variables Ne1 and xa2. Note
that Ne2 and xa1 could be obtained in a similar manner,
however, results were qualitatively comparable and we
therefore only show results for Ne1 versus xa2. The same
strategy was used to investigate the relationship between
w and Ne.

Results
To investigate the correlation between the rate of adaptive
evolution and Ne, we compiled data from 13 phylogenetically
independent pairs of species (table 1; supplementary figures
S1 and S2, Supplementary Material online). We measured
the rate of adaptive evolution using the statistic xa, which
is the rate of adaptive substitution at nonsynonymous sites relative to the rate of synonymous substitution, using a method
that takes into account the contribution of slightly deleterious
mutations to polymorphism and divergence (Eyre-Walker and

Keightley 2009; Keightley and Eyre-Walker 2012). We
estimated Ne by dividing the synonymous site nucleotide
diversity by an estimate of the mutation rate per generation,
taken from the literature. We also divided the synonymous
sites into two groups when estimating xa and Ne in order
to ensure that the estimates were statistically independent.
Estimates of xa and Ne are given in table 2.
There is a nonsignificant positive correlation between
xa and Ne for the individual data points (Pearson’s
correlation r 5 0.16, P 5 0.61; fig. 1). However, there
is also a positive correlation between the two variables
for all groups for which we have two or more data points
(Plants: r 5 0.74, P 5 0.056; Drosophilidae: r 5 0.55, P 5
0.63; Mammals: r 5 1.00, P not given because there are
just two data points), suggesting that differences
between taxonomic groups may obscure a significant
correlation within the groups. To investigate this further,
we performed an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA),
grouping organisms as mammals, plants, Drosophila,
and fungi. In ANCOVA, a set of parallel lines are fitted
to the data, one for each group. This enables a test of
whether the common slope of these lines is significantly different from zero, and one can also investigate whether the
groups differ in the dependent variable for a given value
of the independent variable by testing whether the lines
have different intercepts. Using ANCOVA, we find that xa and
Ne are significantly positively correlated (P 5 0.017). Furthermore, there is significant variation between the intercepts
(P 5 0.044). There is also a positive correlation between
xa and log(Ne) (P 5 0.018), although the difference between intercepts is no longer significant (P 5 0.12). The

results therefore suggest that xa and Ne are positively correlated and that the level of adaptive evolution may vary
between groups for a given Ne.
The correlation between xa and Ne might be genuine, but
it might also have arisen as an artifact, generated by
changes in population size. For example, if species with large
current Ne tend to have undergone population expansion
and/or species with small Ne population size contraction,
then a positive correlation between xa and Ne would be induced because population size expansion leads to an overestimate of xa and contraction to an underestimate if there
are slightly deleterious mutations (Eyre-Walker 2002). We
investigated whether changes in population size explain

the correlation between xa and Ne by taking advantage of the
fact that the method we used to estimate xa simultaneously
fits a demographic model to the data. In this model, the
population experiences a k-fold change in population size
t generations in the past. The results of our analysis suggest
that the correlation between the estimates of Ne and log(k)
are weak and nonsignificant (Pearson: r 5 0.41, P 5 0.15;
ANCOVA: slope P 5 0.61) or between log(Ne) and log(k)
(Pearson r 5 0.15, P 5 0.61; ANCOVA: slope P 5 0.93);
thus, there is no evidence that species with large current
Ne have undergone recent expansion and/or that species
with small current Ne have undergone recent contraction.
We also find little evidence that xa is correlated to log(k)
(Pearson: r 5 0.17, P 5 0.57; ANCOVA: P 5 0.97), implying
that the correlation between xa and Ne is not an artifact of
changes in population size. It should be noted, however,
that this test is not definitive because MK-based approaches
are sensitive to differences in the Ne experienced by the polymorphism and the divergence data (McDonald and Kreitman
1991; Eyre-Walker 2002; Eyre-Walker and Keightley 2009).
For example, a species might have experienced an expansion
that predates the origin of the polymorphism data but is nevertheless recent in comparison with the overall divergence
between the species being considered. In this case, there
would be no evidence of expansion in the polymorphism
data, but Ne for the polymorphism data would be greater
than the average Ne during the divergence of the species. This
would artifactually increase the estimate of xa.
A second explanation for the correlation between xa and
Ne could be selection at synonymous sites. If the effectiveness of selection on synonymous sites increases with Ne,
then this predicts a decrease in the level of synonymous
divergence relative to polymorphism, leading to overestimation of adaptive nonsynonymous evolution. Although we
might expect the effectiveness of selection on synonymous
sites to increase with Ne, the evidence is mixed. Selection
appears to be more effective on synonymous codon bias
in Drosophila simulans than D. melanogaster (Akashi
1996; McVean and Vieira 2001), and Ne is thought to be
larger in the former species (Aquadro et al. 1988; Akashi
1996). However, in mammals, selection appears to be more
effective on synonymous sites in hominids than rodents
(Eory et al. 2010), yet Ne is substantially larger in wild mice
than hominids (Eyre-Walker 2002; Halligan et al. 2010). Furthermore, selection on synonymous codon use appears to
have little effect on estimates of a in D. pseudoobscura,
D. miranda, and D. affinis (Haddrill et al. 2010).
To investigate whether the correlation between xa and Ne
might be due to selection on synonymous sites, we performed two analyses. First, we investigated whether xa and
our estimate of Ne were correlated to codon usage bias, as
measured by the ENC and ENC taking into account base
composition (ENC#). xa is negatively correlated to ENC
and ENC#, as expected if selection on synonymous codon

use was causing an artifactual increase in xa, but in neither
case was the correlation significant (ENC vs. xa: r 5 0.481,
P 5 0.096; ANCOVA slope: P 5 0.40; ENC# vs. xa:
r 5 0.495, P 5 0.085; ANCOVA slope: P 5 0.430). Furthermore, the correlation between Ne or log(Ne) and ENC
or ENC# are nonsignificant (ENC vs. Ne: r 5 0.15,
P 5 0.61; ANCOVA slope: P 5 0.61; ENC# vs. Ne:
r 5 0.04, P 5 0.89; ANCOVA slope: P 5 0.66; ENC
vs. log(Ne): r 5 0.23, P 5 0.44; ANCOVA slope:
P 5 0.87; ENC# vs. log(Ne): r 5 0.15, P 5 0.61; ANCOVA
slope: P 5 0.86). Hence, there is little evidence that the
correlation between xa and Ne is a consequence codon
usage bias.
In the second analysis, we estimated xa while simultaneously estimating the strength of negative selection on synonymous sites. We also corrected our estimate of the effective
population size for the effect of selection on synonymous
sites. Estimates of Ne, xa and the strength of selection on synonymous mutations are given in table 2. The results of this
analysis show some evidence of selection on synonymous
sites in four species: Oryza rufipogon, Zea mays, human,
and mouse. There is independent evidence of selection in
Homo sapiens (Iida and Akashi 2000; Hellmann et al.
2003; Chamary et al. 2006; Keightley et al. 2011) and mouse
(Chamary and Hurst 2004; Gaffney and Keightley 2005;
Keightley et al. 2011) but also in P. tremula (Ingvarsson
2010), D. melanogaster (Zeng and Charlesworth 2009),
D. pseudoobscura (Akashi and Schaeffer 1997; Haddrill
et al. 2011), and D. miranda (Bartolomé et al. 2005; Haddrill
et al. 2011) for which we do not find evidence of selection at
synonymous sites. The failure to detect selection on synonymous sites may be due to the strength of the selection being
weak, and furthermore, we have assumed a model with
constant population size. This was necessary because it
is not possible to simultaneously fit a model that allows
demographic change and selection on synonymous codon
use in the absence of detailed information about codon
preferences (Zeng and Charlesworth 2010). Correcting
for selection on synonymous sites, we find that the correlation between xa and Ne is positive but not significant,
whereas the correlation between xa and log(Ne) is positive
and significant with ANCOVA (slope P 5 0.028, intercept
P 5 0.032). Although not conclusive, these results suggest
that the correlation between xa and Ne is not due to selection on synonymous codon use.
A third possible explanation for the correlation between
xa and Ne is biased gene conversion (BGC). Like selection
upon synonymous codon use, BGC can elevate the ratio
of polymorphism to divergence relative to neutral expectations. However, it is less clear that this will affect synonymous sites preferentially.
We might expect that just as the number of adaptive
substitutions increases with Ne, the number of effectively
neutral substitutions will decline. We estimated the number

of effectively neutral substitutions as xna 5x  xa , and found
that xa is significantly negatively correlated to Ne (r 5 0.24,
P 5 0.43; ANCOVA slope P 5 0.05; intercept P 5 0.04) and
log(Ne) (r 5 0.53, P 5 0.06; ANCOVA slope P 5 0.14;
intercept P 5 0.23). The slopes of the regression lines, from
the ANCOVA, between xna and Ne are similar in magnitude
to those between xa and Ne (2.4  108 vs. 2.5  108).
We also investigated whether aspects of the DFE of deleterious mutations, as estimated from the polymorphism
data, are correlated to Ne. We find a significant negative
correlation between w and Ne with ANCOVA controlling
for the nonindependence between these variables (Pearson r 5 0.24, P 5 0.42; ANCOVA slope P 5 0.014; intercepts P 5 0.006) and between w and log(Ne) with Pearson
(Pearson r 5 0.64, P 5 0.018; ANCOVA slope P 5
0.016; intercepts P 5 0.041), but correlations between the
shape parameter of the DFE and the mean value of Nes
and Ne are nonsignificant. The lack of a significant correlation between mean Nes and Ne could be a consequence
of the low precision of estimates mean Nes (Keightley and
Eyre-Walker 2007).

Discussion
We have presented evidence that the rate of adaptive protein
evolution is positively correlated to Ne. We have shown that
it is unlikely that this is due to recent demographic changes
or selection on synonymous sites. Such a result is not unexpected. If the rate of adaptive evolution is limited by the
supply of new mutations, then species with larger Ne are
expected to undergo more adaptive evolution than species
with small Ne because a greater number of advantageous
mutations appear in the population and a higher proportion
of these mutations are effectively selected.
The positive correlation between xa and Ne is consistent
with a model in which the rate of adaptive evolution is limited
by the supply of new mutations. The correlation seems less
consistent with a model in which adaptation comes from
standing genetic variation (Pritchard et al. 2010; Pritchard
and Rienzo 2010) for two reasons. First, although the level
of advantageous, neutral, and slightly deleterious genetic
variation is expected to be correlated to Ne, this correlation
appears to be weak; levels of diversity, at least in mammalian
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), are poorly correlated to effective population size (Piganeau and Eyre-Walker 2009). This is
probably due to a negative correlation between the rate of
mutation per generation and the effective population size
(Lynch 2007; Piganeau and Eyre-Walker 2009). Second,
the level of diversity of strongly deleterious mutations is expected to be either independent of the effective population
size or negatively correlated to it, since species with long generation times, and small effective population size, appear to
have higher rates of mutation per generation (Keightley and
Eyre-Walker 2000; Piganeau and Eyre-Walker 2009).

664

We have shown that species with large Ne undergo
more adaptive substitutions than species with small Ne.
However, this does not necessarily mean that these species
adapt faster, though this is likely. This is because the total
rate of adaptive evolution is a product of the number of
adaptive substitutions and the effects of those substitutions.
It is possible that species with large Ne undergo more adaptive
substitutions but that these are smaller in magnitude. We
have also not considered adaptive evolution outside of
protein-coding genes.
The positive correlation between the rate of adaptive
evolution and Ne implies that detecting the signature of
adaptive evolution using MK approaches is likely to be difficult in species with small Ne because they are expected to
have undergone low levels of adaptive evolution. Furthermore, they are likely to have a higher proportion of effectively
neutral mutations, which tends to obscure the signature
of adaptive evolution. For example, assume that we have
two species with the same number of synonymous polymorphisms (20) and substitutions (100) in a sample of genes.
Assume that the two species have undergone the same
number of adaptive nonsynonymous substitutions (15)
but that species A has experienced no neutral mutations,
whereas species B has undergone as many effectively neutral nonsynonymous mutations as synonymous mutations.
Under the assumption that adaptive mutations contribute
little to polymorphism the MK tables for the two species
would be as given in table 3. It is evident that adaptive evolution would be detected in species A using a standard MK
test (i.e., a v2 test of independence), but not in species B,
because although both species have undergone the same
amount of adaptive evolution, this is obscured by the large
number of effectively neutral substitutions in species B. The
fact that large numbers of effectively neutral substitutions
obscure the signature of adaptive evolution means that it will
be more difficult to detect adaptive evolution in poorly conserved regions of the genome, such as regulatory sequences.
We have found some evidence that the rate of adaptive
evolution varies between groups of organisms for a given
Ne. In particular, it is striking that the fungus S. paradoxus
has the largest Ne among the species we have considered,
but shows no evidence of adaptive evolution. If we remove
S. paradoxus from the ANCOVA, we find no evidence
that the rate of adaptive evolution differs between groups
(ANCOVA intercepts P 5 0.47), although xa is correlated to
Ne (ANCOVA slope P 5 0.017). It is possible that S. paradoxus
has a low rate of adaptive evolution, despite its large Ne,
because it is largely asexual (Tsai et al. 2008). Consistent
with this, we note that there is a negative correlation between dn /ds and some measure of effective population in
a number of nonrecombining genetic systems. In mammalian mtDNA, dn /ds is correlated to body size (Popadin et al.
2007), which is believed to be correlated to Ne, and in both
mammals and birds, the largely nonrecombining Y and W

NOTE.—Comparison between two hypothetical species (A and B) that have the same number of adaptive changes but different effective population sizes illustrated by
a difference in the number of effectively neutral nonsynonymous sites. n.a., not applicable.

chromosomes, which are believed to have lower Ne than
the autosomes, have higher dn/ds values (Wyckoff et al.
2002; Berlin and Ellegren 2006). In contrast, we find no
evidence of a significant correlation between dn/ds and
Ne in our analysis (r 5 0.37, P 5 0.21; ANCOVA slope
P 5 0.34). This might be due to our small sample size,
but it also may reflect a difference between recombining
and nonrecombining loci. In our analysis, we find that
the rate of adaptive substitution increases with Ne at a similar rate to the rate at which the effectively neutral substitutions decreases; this leaves the dn/ds uncorrelated to Ne.
It might be that rates of adaptive evolution are lower in
nonrecombining systems, and hence, the decline in the
number of effectively neutral substitutions dominates
the relationship between dn/ds and Ne, and species such
as S. paradoxus undergo little adaptive evolution.

Selection Intensity for Codon Bias and the Effective Population
Size of Escherichia coli

ABSTRACT
The selection intensity for codon bias and the synonymous diversity have been used in the recent
literature to estimate the effective population size of Eschm'chia coli. The results have varied between lo5
and 10'. It is suggested here that most of this disparity can beexplained by a model that accounts for the
population structure of the species. Thus it is assumed that weakly selected characters, like synonymous
substitutions, are selectively fixed within individual lines or colonies but spread throughout the population in an essentially neutral way when colonies replace one another.In this way, the effective population
size that enters expressions for the codon bias will be that of an individual colony, which, if hitchhiking
effects are considered, can be a very small number. The effective population size that appears together
with the mutation rate in expressions for the synonymous diversity, on the other hand, will be related
to the total number of colonies that make up the species and can be a very large number.

T

HE effective population size of a species is determined in practice by comparing themathematical
expressions for diversity based on some ideal population genetic model with the actual genetic diversity observed. In a recentstudy on the diversity of synonymous
codon usage in homologuous genes from different
strains of Eschm'chia coli, HARTL et al. (1994) deduced
that the effective population size of this species is -2
x lo8. This estimate is close to a commonly accepted
valueof -lo9 (e.g., OCHMAN
and WILSON1987) and
leads to a selection coefficient for a preferred codon
of -7 X 10-9.
The preferential use of some synonymous codons
over others, the codon bias, in some species is thought
to be the result of selection for translational efficiency
and/or accuracy (e.&, IKEMURA
1985). Based on a translation model, BULMER
(1991) calculated that thegrowth
advantage and the selection coefficient for a preferred
or major codon would be
(depending
on
gene
expression) and deduced that the effective population
sizeof E . coli isof the order of lo5. This low, some
would say ridiculously low, number agrees with an independent estimate based on the sequence diversityof
binding sites for gene regulatory proteins (BERG1992).
There is a major difference between these disparate
estimates of the effective population size: the large
number from HARTLet al. (1994) is based on the intergenomic diversity (virtual heterozygosity) where the same
gene is compared in different strains; the small numbers (BULMER1991;BERG1992), on the other hand, are
based on the intragenomic diversity, i.e., the nucleotide

selection bias within the same genome. Below it will be
suggested that the heterozygosity and the codon bias
are determinedby different kinds of processesat different levels in the population structure,and that they are
therefore connected to very different estimates of the
effective population size. The codon bias is established
as a local equilibrium ofsynonymous substitutions
within each line and determined by the fixation probabilities of a small population size. The synonymous substitutions are spread throughout the
species as different
lines replace each other via extinction-recolonization
events. The synonymous heterozygosity,therefore, is determined by the genealogy of lines and theirseparation
times, which are related to a large population size determined primarily from the total number of lines. The
distinction between the population sizes for bias and
heterozygosity becomes particularly simple if it can be
assumed that the colonization events are neutral with
respect to the synonymous substitutions.
MODEL

Many model calculations, like those by HARTLet al.
(1994) and BULMER(1991) for instance, assume that
recombination is sufficiently frequent so that each mutation can spread and become fixed independently of
all others. Thus, all of E. coli is considered as a single
population with random mixing of alleles. However, E.
coli has a distinct populationstructure and may be
largely a clonal species (HARTL and DYKHUIZEN1984;
SELANDER
et al. 1987; LENSKI
1993), as is indicated, for
instance, by the strong linkage disequilibrium and by
the fact that it is possible to construct genealogies for
its strains. Furthermore, in comparisons of homologous
genes from E. coli and Salmonella, codon bias is virtually

the same in both species, while differences in heterozygosity suggest different effective population sizes ( G m MAN and DYKHUIZEN
1994). Thus, codon bias cannot
be directly related to the heterozygosity via the same
effective population size.
Consider a group of sites in the genomewhere there
are two nucleotide choices, one selected (weakly) over
the other with selection coefficient s. This group could
consist of, for instance,all sitesfor atwofold degenerate
amino acid where one codon is preferred over the
other. The expected distribution of such synonymous
choices will be the focus of the following discussion.
The central idea is that the population genetics of E.
coli can be considered attwo levels. On thespecies level,
the population is subdvided into a large number of
colonies (lines) (MARUYAMA and KIMURA 1980). These
could either be in the guts of individual animals, or
possibly in larger family groups of animals. It is on the
level of an individual colony that mutations arise and
first become fixed before spreading to others via invasion or recolonization events. The basic assumption, to
be justified further below, is that selection within a colony is very different from selection between colonies.
Fixation within a colony: In contrast to the picture
of complete mixing, below it is assumed that mutations
are tightly linked such that neutral and weakly selected
or counterselected mutations, like the synonymous codon changes considered here, arefixed mostly by hitchhiking (MAYNARDSMITHand HAIGH19'74) with a new
strongly selected variant. A colony in a chemostat continuosly undergoes periodic selection events (selective
sweeps) when new strongly selected mutations appear
and take over the population (e.g.,HELLING
et al. 1987).
This seems to be mostly a consequence of the large size
of the colony, and it can be argued thatcolonies in "the
wild" will behave in a similar manner (MARUYAMA and
IMURA
1980; LEVIN1981; IMURA
1983; BERG 1995).
The substitution rates, a , and a 2 ,whereby the selected
codon (with selection coefficient s) replaces the counterselected one throughout the colony and vice versa,
can be calculated in a hitchhiking model(BARTON1994;
BERG 1995). The results are determined primarily by
the parameter combination ST,where Tis the average
time between periodic selection events. If hitchhiking
is the dominant process, one finds (BERG1995)

a,

=

u

exp(sT) - 1
ST
'

(14

where u is the mutation rate constant.The corresponding result from a random-mixing haploid two-allele
model for a stable population of size N,, (e.g., BULMER
1991) is

When 2N,,,s and

ST are not

larger than 1, these two

expressions, ( l a ) and ( l b ) ,give virtually the same result
if 2Nc0,s isreplaced by sT (BERGand MARTELIUS 1995).
Similarly, the codon bias is found to be
B = a 1 / a 2= exp(sT)

(24

if hitchhiking dominates, and
(2b)
B = a 1 / a 2= exp(2NCols)
in the random mixing model. Thus, the main effect of
hitchhiking is to introduce 2N,,, as the time between
selective sweeps in a colony. This can be a very small
number compared to the real population sizeof the
colony.
Fixation throughout the species: On the species
level, let us assume with MARUYAMA and IMURA
(1980)
that the total population of E. coli can be subdivided
into n distinct local subpopulations (colonies, lines).
A colony becomes extinct with the probability A per
generation and is replaced by members from another
colony (recolonization). "Aand KIMURA (1980)
showed that the effective population size for neutral
heterozygosity in this situation is dominated by the
number of colonies:
Nnh ifn/2A

n %- 1.

(3)

In this model, Nnhcorresponds to the average time to
the most recent common ancestor
of two randomly chosen colonies. Furthermore, the probability p(t) per unit
time that two randomly chosen colonies split off from
their most recent common ancestral colony in arecolonization event at time t before the present is exponentially distributed with density (HUDSON1990)

During the separation time t, each colony (line) has
been accumulating mutations. One finds that the expected fraction of sites that are differentafter time t of
separation is (BERGand MARTELIUS 1995)
2B

+ B)'

[1 - exp(-2(a1

+ a2)t)],

(5)

. the case considered
where the bias is B = a 1 / a 2 In
here, a 1and a2refer to the rates of synonymousreplacement within a colony as discussed above (Equations 1
and 2). Once a mutation is fixed in a colony, it can
spread to others via colonization events. In the model
of MARUYAMA and KIMURA (1980) the invading line in
a recolonization is randomly chosen and the replacements of colonies therefore nonselective. In this picture, the spreading
of the synonymous changes through
colony replacements will be neutral and expressed by
(3) and (4).As discussed further below, it is not unlikely
that this spreading will be essentially neutral also in a
more realistic picture where colony replacements are
due to invasion-takeover events in which case A corre-

sponds to a rate ofinvasion times the probability of
successful takeover.
Heterozygosity: A measure for the heterozygosity is
the average fraction of differences between two randomly chosen individuals. If the individuals are from
different lines, the expectation value for the fraction of
synonymous differences can be calculated as

For a truly neutral mutation, s = 0 and a1 = aP = u,
where u is the mutation rate constant (forsimplicity of
discussion, u is assumed to be the same in both directions), one finds from (6)

where Nnhfrom (3) is the effective population size for
neutral heterozygosity. Equation 7 has the term 4uNnh
in the denominator rather than2uNnh,as given by MARUYM
and KIMURA (1980), since this is a two-allele
model rather than the infinite-allele model considered
by them.
Rewriting the expression for the expected fraction of
differences, (6), using (lb) and (2b), one finds

The structure of this expression remains the same if
one uses the hitchhiking model within the colony, (la)
and (2a), instead. Thus, the effective population size
enters the result in two places: in combination with
the mutation rate constant
u, one finds the effective
population size for neutral heterozygosity Nnh
from (3);
together with the selection coefficient s one finds the
local effective population size of a colony, Ncol.
DISCUSSION

The calculations above show how one can get very
different estimates for theeffective population size associated with codon bias and with synonymous heterozygosity. The crucial assumption in the present model is
that synonymous differences are spread throughout the
population in an essentially neutral wayas different
lines replace each other. In a picture where lines must
compete with each other in a colony replacement, this
requires that theyhave picked up different kinds of
strongly favorable mutations during their different recent histories. If so, a few synonymous differences will
not be decisive and will therefore be neutral. The periodic selection experiments (HELLING
et al. 1987; LENSKI
et al. 1991) suggest that the organism readily picks up
favorable mutations even after a long time in the same
environment. The selection coefficients for these favorable mutations are found to be of the order of lo",

1381

while the synonymous codon changes are estimated to
havevery small selection coefficients, anywhere from
(BULMER1991) to
(HARTL et al. 1994).Natural
populations of E. coli probably cycle through many different kinds of environments and may pick up different
favorable mutations in the process. Thus E. coli may be
well adapted not to a stable environment but to an
unpredictable one that is continuously changing. The
alternative view that all strains of E. coli are equally and
optimally adapted to all itsnatural environments so that
very few strongly favorable mutations ever occur seems
less likely to me; however, this is a conjecture that remains to be tested.
Ina chemostat, selectivesweepstake
place about
once every hundred generations or so (HELLING
et al.
1987).This corresponds to a "local effectivepopulation
size" on the order of N,, = 10'. For colonies in the
wild, selective sweepsmay be less frequent and N,, correspondingly larger. Replacements of resident strains
in the intestinal flora may take place with a comparable
rate (SELANDER
et al. 1987) and may therefore interfere
with periodic selection. Such invasion-recolonization
events probably involve a very small number of cells
and will therefore lead to a random sampling of the
genetic variants in the invading line. If the invader were
a single cell, each invasion-takeoverwouldhave the
same effect for hitchhiking as a periodic selection event.
However, since an invasion is not likely to start with a
single cell, the random sampling of the invading line
will beamore
complicated process thana periodic
selection event and the correspondingeffective population size would be increased. Thus, N,,, which appears
together with the selection coefficient s, both in the
codon bias (Equation 2) and in the synonymous diversity (Equation 6), can be a very small number, though
probably not as small as10'. Hitchhiking is not an essential part of the present model calculations, but it provides an obvious mechanism by which the effective population size of a colony can be very small.
The effective population size for the process of
spreading the weak mutation across the whole E. coli
population is determined by Nnh,which, from (3),probably is larger than the number of colonies. Some genetic material in E. coli has spread faster through the
population and therefore has a much lower divergence
than others (GUTTMAN
and DYKHUIZEN
1994). Such material is thought to be linked to some strongly selected
mutation and spread also via recombination. Effectively
such parts of thegenome will have a faster rate of
spreading (larger X) and therefore smaller Nnh.Clearly,
the random-replacement model of MARUYAMA and IMLJRA (1980) used above is only a first approximation
that needs to be extended to include such more complex processes.

(1991) number for the mutation rate u = 5 x lo"',
they find the effective population size Ne = 2 X 10'.
Inserting this estimate for Ne in the result for sN,, they
deduce that the selection intensity for a preferred synonymous codon is extremely small, s
7 X lo-'. As
support for their results, HARTLet al. (1994) also look
at the intragenomic diversity as determined by the codon bias, sN, = 0.5 ln(B) from (2), and find that this
is essentially the same as that determined from the intergenomic diversity. In spite of the uncertainty in many
of the numbers, this indeed provides strong independent support for the usefulness of their theory. However, based on the analysis presented above, I would
argue that if one uses a random-mixing model for a
species with a strongly structured population, like E.
coli, it is necessary to consider (at least) two very different numbers for the effective population size: the local
size N, = NCol,
which appears in combination with the
selection coefficient s, could well be lo5 or smaller; the
other and much larger number, Ne = Nnhfrom (3),
appears together with the mutation rate u and could
well be lo9 or larger. Thus BULMER'S(1991) estimate
based on translational efficiency for the selection coefficient of
forapreferredcodon
may be reasonable and the findings of WTL
et al. (1994) could be
reconciled with the well supported notion (e.g., IKEMURA 1985) that codon bias in E. coli is determined in
some wayby translational efficiency.
The primary purpose of the presentmodel is to show
how a simple allowance for the population structurein
a straightforward way can account for the very disparate
estimates of the effective population size. Some of the
assumptions are clearly oversimplified, asdiscussed,
and will require moreextensive workbefore real quantitative predictions can be made. On the other hand,this
situation is no different from that of existing randommixing models where the single estimate of Ne is used
as a fitting parameter: the effective population size is
simply that number that is required to make the diversity of the real population look like that of an ideal
random-mixing population ofsize Ne. In the present
model, two such fitting parameters are required and it
is also shown how they may arise in the dynamics of a
structured population.

Summary
We describe a systematic genome-wide approach for
learning the complex combinatorial code underlying
gene expression. Our probabilistic approach identifies
local DNA-sequence elements and the positional and
combinatorial constraints that determine their context-dependent role in transcriptional regulation. The
inferred regulatory rules correctly predict expression
patterns for 73% of genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, utilizing microarray expression data and sequences in the 800 bp upstream of genes. Application
to Caenorhabditis elegans identifies predictive regulatory elements and combinatorial rules that control the
phased temporal expression of transcription factors,
histones, and germline specific genes. Successful prediction requires diverse and complex rules utilizing
AND, OR, and NOT logic, with significant constraints
on motif strength, orientation, and relative position.
This system generates a large number of mechanistic
hypotheses for focused experimental validation, and
establishes a predictive dynamical framework for understanding cellular behavior from genomic sequence.
Introduction
At the heart of the complexity of multicellular life is the
proper context-dependent expression of genes. To
achieve this, cells have evolved a highly interconnected
transcriptional network composed of signaling molecules, transcription factors (TFs), and their DNA targets
(Levine and Tjian, 2003). The mRNA expression level of
a gene is typically determined by several input signals,
through the cis-regulatory logic encoded in its noncoding regulatory DNA sequences (Davidson et al., 2003).
This cis-regulatory logic is fundamental to many processes, including physiological adaptation, generation
of cell diversity, and morphological development.
With the arrival of whole-genome approaches for measuring the expression of genes, and computational
methods for extracting biological insights from such
data, there is an emerging movement to learn the structural and dynamical properties of transcriptional networks on a genomic scale (Eisen et al., 1998; Gardner
et al., 2003; Hughes et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2002; Tavazoie
et al., 1999). An important and fortuitous aspect of transcriptional network organization is that large sets of
genes tend to be coexpressed at the mRNA level (Eisen
et al., 1998; Tamayo et al., 1999; Tavazoie et al., 1999),
consistent with the notion that many cellular processes
*Correspondence: tavazoie@molbio.princeton.edu

require the simultaneous participation of many gene
products. Comparative analysis has shown that the
coexpression of many of these genes are conserved
across diverse species (Stuart et al., 2003), but little is
known about the underlying mechanisms by which these
genes are regulated. Pattern recognition algorithms can
be used to identify overrepresented DNA sequence elements, or motifs, in the presumptive regulatory regions
of these groups of coexpressed genes (Tavazoie et al.,
1999). In the yeast S. cerevisiae, many of these motifs
correspond to previously known transcription factor
binding sites (Tavazoie et al., 1999). However, the presence of a single motif is only marginally predictive of a
gene’s expression pattern. This reflects the extent of
combinatorial regulation even in this simple eukaryote,
where the expression level of a gene can depend on the
occupancy states of multiple TF binding sites. Consistent with this, many S. cerevisiae genes have been experimentally shown to bind multiple TFs within their regulatory regions (Lee et al., 2002).
In this article we describe a computational approach
for inferring the cis-regulatory logic of transcriptional
networks from genome-wide mRNA expression data
and DNA sequence. We use a probabilistic framework
that is complementary to classical genetic techniques:
after finding sets of coexpressed genes, our approach
identifies the common, but potentially complex, DNA
sequence features which are responsible for their regulation. We begin with a set of microarray expression
data, and use a clustering algorithm (Hartigan, 1975) to
find diverse sets of genes that are coexpressed across
a set of conditions. Each of these sets of genes defines
a distinct expression pattern across the experimental
conditions (others have used the term module, or regulon). We then find a large set of putative regulatory DNA
elements, or motifs, which are overrepresented in each
expression pattern (Lawrence et al., 1993; Neuwald et
al., 1995; Roth et al., 1998). A Bayesian network (Friedman et al., 2000; Pearl, 1988) is then used to infer the
mapping between these sequence elements and the
expression patterns. The network uses each gene’s 5⬘
upstream sequence elements and their related properties as input variables, and outputs the probability of
having a particular expression pattern. Thus, the inferred
network describes the set of sequence elements and
the positional and combinatorial constraints required
for a gene to be expressed in a particular expression
pattern. The network encodes that part of the cis-regulatory code which is active under the experimental conditions explored in the expression data.
Results and Discussion
Predicting Gene Expression
Systematic experimentation has acquired a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation for a handful of well-studied genes, but we lack
the tools to achieve this level of understanding on a
whole-genome scale. Here, as a formal step in this direc-

tion, we quantify the degree to which we can predict a
gene’s expression pattern by looking only at its regulatory sequences. We separate the genes into two sets,
a training set where we will learn the regulatory DNA
elements and combinatorial rules, and a test set which
we will reserve only for prediction, or evaluation of
our model.
The results of this approach have several fundamental
biological implications. First, we are able to measure
the degree to which gene expression is determined by
local sequence, and we find that it is, perhaps surprisingly, high. Second, we can globally evaluate the degree
to which different types of combinatorial regulation are
utilized across the experimental conditions explored in
the dataset. Third, we generate a set of high confidence
predictions for regulatory DNA sequence elements, and
the positional and combinatorial constraints that determine their function. Thus for thousands of genes, simultaneously and systematically, our approach finds the
set of DNA sequence elements most likely to be responsible for each gene’s proper context dependent expression.
While our automated approach is generally applicable
to any microarray expression dataset, here we combine
environmental stresses (Gasch et al., 2000) and cell cycle (Spellman et al., 1998), for 255 total conditions. This
dataset explores a diverse set of experimental conditions, and the significant redundancy improves signal
to noise. Noise in the expression data may present the
greatest limitation on our ability to correctly predict gene
expression, and imposes certain constraints on our approach. We must deal with the fact that under each
condition, the measured gene expression level may be
significantly different than the gene’s actual expression.
The degree to which coregulated genes are actually
coexpressed in the expression data is demonstrated in
Figure 1. For purposes of visualization, in Figure 1A, we
have used a force-directed placement algorithm (Davidson et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2001) which places highly
correlated genes near each other. This visualization emphasizes the fact that gene expression is continuous,
not discrete, and that groups of coregulated genes are
not generally distinct, but overlap. Figure 1A shows two
large responses, a stress induced response in the midlower left, and a stress-repressed response in the top
of the figure. But within these large sets are smaller
groups of genes, with tighter coexpression, which participate in common biological processes. We find these
expression profiles using a modification of the standard
k-means algorithm (see Experimental Procedures). The
number of expression patterns is determined automatically, and for what follows, we focus on a clustering
which assigned 2587 genes to 49 expression patterns.
These expression patterns are significantly enriched for
genes of similar function, as shown in Table 1, using
Bonferoni corrected P-values from the hypergeometric
distribution. The mean of each of these expression patterns is shown in Supplemental Data, Supplemental Figure S1 available at http://www.cell.com/cgi/content/full/
117/2/185/DC1. The genes in nine of these expression
patterns are emphasized in color in Figure 1A.
While many of these expression patterns are similar
over subsets of the data, using all conditions to distinguish between subtly different expression patterns allows

us to learn their distinct modes of regulation. Figure 1B
shows the expression of each gene in four of these
expression patterns, as well as the mean of the expression pattern. For example, 138 genes participate in expression pattern (1), 122 of which are ribosomal proteins
(P ⬍ 8.5 ⫻ 10⫺175). Expression pattern (4) has 114 genes,
21 of which are known to be involved in rRNA transcription (P ⬍ 3.5 ⫻ 10⫺14). While these sets of genes are
very similar in expression, the subtle differences are
potentially biologically significant: the rRNA transcription genes are more repressed under heat shock and
turn off more rapidly under diamide treatment than the
ribosomal proteins (see bottom of Figure 1B). We correctly predict 94% and 92% of the genes in these expression patterns, recapitulating the subtle difference
in expression. Our predictions for these two sets of
genes involve completely different programs of regulation: the ribosomal proteins are predicted to be regulated by the DNA element known to be bound by RAP1
(with significant constraints on its orientation and the
presence of an appropriate regulatory partner), while
the rRNA transcription genes are predicted to be regulated by the PAC and RRPE DNA elements (with constraints on their position relative to ATG), as discussed
below. These results indicate that having two separate
regulatory mechanisms for the production of the RNA
and protein components of the ribosome may be important in the biology of yeast. Similar distinctions separate
the stress-induced expression pattern (3) and the proteolytic degradation (proteasome) expression pattern (28).
Probabilistic Model
A Bayesian network (Pearl, 1988) describes relationships of probabilistic dependency between variables. In
our case, we are interested in learning how a given gene
will be expressed, under certain experimental conditions, given its 5⬘ upstream DNA sequences. While many
methods could be applied to this task, we chose the
Bayesian framework because of its natural way of dealing with incomplete information, and its ability to encode
arbitrary dependencies between variables. The Bayesian approach to gene regulatory networks has been pioneered by Friedman and coworkers (Friedman et al.,
2000; Segal et al., 2003), and our work is motivated by
their progress. Their work (Friedman et al., 2000; Segal
et al., 2003) builds regulatory networks by finding correlations between the mRNA levels of a regulatory gene
(e.g., a known TF) and a regulated gene. However, many
TFs are regulated by posttranscriptional mechanisms
(e.g., nuclear import/export, phosphorylation, proteolytic degradation, interaction with small ligands, or at
the level of translation). Ideally, we need to correlate the
nuclear concentration of a transcription factor protein in
its active state with a regulated gene’s mRNA transcript
abundance. However, we do not in general have this information.
Our approach circumvents this difficulty by building
a network, which is not gene-to-gene, but is sequenceto-gene. The determinants of gene expression levels
in our model are short DNA sequence elements, not
transcription factor mRNA levels. These sequence elements serve as a proxy for the active nuclear concentration of a TF: if an active TF recognizes a particular DNA

sequence element, those genes with the sequence element will respond in a particular way—those genes without the element will not. Figure 2A shows a graphical
representation of our framework. This approach can also
describe regulation by chromatin-modifying complexes
to the extent that they are targeted by a sequence specific factor (Kurdistani et al., 2002). Our approach may
also describe the possibility that DNA structural elements (e.g., a particularly rigid or flexible region) may be
involved in regulation, if such elements allow or impede
access by other factors.
Several features of our approach turn out to be essential for predictive accuracy. (1) We learn DNA sequence
motifs from expression patterns found in the expression
dataset, so our set of motifs are those which are functional over the set of conditions we wish to predict. (2)
We represent the motifs with position weight matrices
(PWMs; Stormo and Fields, 1998), rather than consensus
words or k-mers. (3) We learn the functional depth of
each motif from the expression data, instead of using
a fixed number of sites for each motif, as has been
standard. (4) Our description of the sequence constraints is as general as possible, and potentially includes: the position of the motif relative to translation
start (ATG), the orientation of the motif, the order and
spacing between particular motifs, combinations of motifs, or the absence of motifs. (5) The mapping from
sequence to expression is probabilistic and nonlinear,
i.e., the expression level of each gene is not modeled

as a linear superposition of effects of individual transcription factors. A nonlinear model allows flexibility for
cooperativity between various transcription factors.
RRPE and PAC, a Case Study
in Combinatorial Regulation
Two computationally discovered sequence elements,
PAC and RRPE (Hughes et al., 2000; Tavazoie et al.,
1999), exemplify the type of combinatorial regulation our
network must describe in order to achieve predictive
accuracy. These motifs were found in an expression
pattern enriched for ribosomal RNA transcription and
processing genes. If we take the top 404 genes with an
upstream PAC element, and the top 403 genes with
RRPE, 167 of these genes have both elements (by random chance we expect only 27 to have both). The degree
of coregulation of any set of genes selected by a regulatory sequence constraint can be quantified by finding
the distribution of pair-wise Pearson correlation coefficients, Cij, for all genes in the set, as shown in the insert
in Figure 2C. This probability distribution is a histogram
of the observed correlation coefficients. Figure 2C shows
this distribution for genes in three sets: those genes
with only PAC, only RRPE, or both PAC and RRPE,
compared to the distribution for all genes. Those genes
with both elements are significantly more correlated
than genes with just one element, reflecting their involvement in coregulation.
While genes with both PAC and RRPE are highly corre-

Mapping Sequence to Gene Expression
189

Figure 2. Sequence Elements that Determine the Regulation of a Set of Genes Involved in Ribosomal RNA Transcription and Processing
(A) Schematic of the logical structure of our approach. We use observable sequence elements to find complex promoter features, which are
predictive of coexpression.
(B) The mathematical framework is a Bayesian network which maps general sequence features (x1…xn) to expression patterns (ei) by encoding
P(ei|x1,x2,…,xn ), the probability that genes with these sequence features will participate in expression pattern i.
(C) Distribution of pair-wise correlation coefficients (insert) of all genes in the following sets: PAC only, RRPE only, both PAC and RRPE, and
all genes. Genes with both PAC and RRPE are significantly more correlated.
(D) The effect of the order of the two elements relative to the promoter. Genes are much more tightly correlated if PAC is on the promoter
side of RRPE.

lated, there are still many genes in that set which are
not. By testing a large number of pair-wise sequence
constraints, we find that the order of the two elements
strongly affects the degree of correlation. If PAC is closer
to the promoter than RRPE, the genes are much more
correlated than if RRPE is closer to the promoter (Figure
2D). It has been previously noted that there are also
statistically significant biases in the spacing between
the two motifs, distance to ATG, and orientation, in addition to order (Hughes et al., 2000; Pilpel et al., 2001;
Sudarsanam et al., 2002; Tavazoie et al., 1999). While
we find that order is a significant determinant of coregulation, each of these alternative constraints also selects
a more correlated subset of the genes that have both
PAC and RRPE. We can find many rules that select sets
of coregulated genes, but the Bayesian approach finds
the most probable constraint, that which makes the observed data most likely.

Systematic and Genome-Wide Learning
of Combinatorial Regulatory Rules
To incorporate specific combinatorial effects like PAC
and RRPE, our description of motif interactions is as
general as possible. We allow our probabilistic model
to encode all the constraints on a motif discussed above:
its presence in the 5⬘ upstream region of a gene, its
orientation, its distance to ATG, its functional depth
(PWM score cut-off for closeness to “consensus”), and
the presence or absence of other motifs. If two or more
motifs are present, we allow the interaction of any pair
to be constrained by the distance between them, or
by their order relative to the promoter. Because the
Bayesian network encodes a joint probability distribution, any of these constraints may be satisfied individually or in particular combinations. These sequence constraints are represented by variables xi, which are either
satisfied for a particular gene (xi ⫽ 1), or not (xi ⫽ 0).

Cell
190

These sequence constraints are input variables, or possible parent nodes, in our Bayesian network. The final
network encodes the distribution P(ei|x1,x2,…,xn), the
probability of being expressed (ei ⫽ 1) or not being expressed (ei ⫽ 0) in expression pattern i, given the states
of the sequence constraints xi. This mathematical structure is represented in Figure 2B.
We learn the structure and probability distributions of
our Bayesian network using modifications of standard
techniques (Heckerman, 1998). We search through sequence space to find the network (N ) which maximizes
the probability that our network is correct, given the
data (D ), using Bayes’ rule: P(N|D) ⫽ P(N)P(D|N)/P(D)
(see Experimental Procedures). We would like to find
the most probable network, but because it is computationally infeasible to score all networks, we use a greedy
search through network space. To avoid local optima,
we learn several (ⵑ10) networks from independent bootstrap samples (a random selection of N samples, with
replacement, from the N samples in the training dataset).
Because of this sampling, each of these networks can
potentially find different sequence constraints, and each
gives a prediction for the probability of each gene being
expressed in a particular expression pattern. We average these probabilities to give a final prediction (Breiman, 1996).
Gibbs sampling (AlignACE; Roth et al., 1998) is performed on the 5⬘ upstream sequences of the genes in
each of the 49 expression patterns (described above
and in Experimental Procedures) to find overrepresented
sequences, which we represent by position weight matrices (Stormo and Fields, 1998). The predictive power of
these motifs can be measured by a Bayesian score,
which is further optimized using Monte-Carlo simulated
annealing (see Experimental Procedures). We then
score all sites in the genome for closeness to each of
these motifs (ScanACE; Hughes et al., 2000), and normalize the score of each motif to the maximum possible score.
To assess the predictive performance of our network,
before inference, we randomly partition the genes into 5
test sets for crossvalidation. We then infer five networks,
using 80% of the genes as a training set, and 20%
as a test set. Examples of the sequence constraints
selected are shown in Figure 3. Figure 3A shows a network for the “ribosomal RNA transcription” expression
pattern (4). For this bootstrap training sample, the network growth stopped after two parent nodes were
added: PAC and RRPE, constrained by distance to ATG.
By looking at all genes in the training set, the network
finds that if the PAC element is not within 140 bp of ATG,
and RRPE is not within 240 bp of ATG, the probability of
being in expression pattern (4) is only 1%. If PAC is not
within 140 bp of ATG, but RRPE is within 240 bp, the
probability of being in expression pattern (4) is 22%. If
PAC is within 140 bp of ATG, but RRPE is not within
240 bp, the probability of being in expression pattern
(4) rises to 67%. Finally, having both constraints satisfied
increases a gene’s probability of being in the expression
pattern to 100%. We refer to this as AND logic. To confirm this result from the network, the correlation distribution for all genes with PAC within 140 bp and RRPE
within 240 bp, shown in Figure 4A, is as tight as the
order constraint in Figure 2D, but applies to a larger set
of genes and is thus better supported by the data. In

addition, the set of genes which have PAC and RRPE
with the learned functional depth, but which do not satisfy the distance to ATG constraint, have very low correlation, indistinguishable from random genes (Figure 4A).
Since PAC is constrained to be closer to ATG (140 bp)
than RRPE (240 bp), most of these genes have PAC on
the promoter side of RRPE, but there exist coregulated
genes with RRPE closer to the promoter than PAC, and
by selecting the position constraint over order, the network has chosen the maximally predictive constraint.
This clear delimitation of the set of coregulated genes
would not have been obtained without simultaneously
varying the thresholds for both the functional depth
(closeness to consensus) and the distance to ATG. In
other expression patterns, RRPE and PAC operate with
other sequence elements (see Supplemental Data available on Cell website). Examples of genes which have
PAC and RRPE and satisfy the positional constraint are
shown in Figure 4B. DRS1 is a putative ATP dependent
RNA helicase, RRB1 is involved in ribosome assembly,
RPA49 is the 49 kDa subunit of RNA polymerase A, and
DIM1 is a dimethyladenosine transferase involved in 35S
primary transcript processing. These functions are consistent with their tight regulation, as shown on the right
of Figure 4B. The genes in Figure 4C have strong PAC
and RRPE elements, but do not satisfy the positional
constraint. ATP5 is an ATP synthase, NMT1 is an
N-myristoyl transferase, ESBP6 is a putative monocarboxylate permease, and PTP2 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase. These genes are completely uncorrelated, as
shown on the right of Figure 4C.
Other common logical constraints inferred by the network are redundancy (OR logic), or the requirement for
the absence of a particular motif (NOT logic). A network
learned on a stress-induced expression pattern (Figure
3B) demonstrates both. Here, the STRE-like elements
(x1 and x2) are similar, but select different sets of genes.
These two motifs were chosen over the canonical STRE
(AGGGG; Martinez-Pastor et al., 1996), and x2 has a
strict requirement for upstream Ts. Genes with x1 are in
expression pattern (2) 59% of the time, in the absence
of the other two motifs, and genes with only x2 are in
expression pattern (2) 75% of the time, but the sets are
largely distinct (only five genes have both x1 and x2). This
is an example of OR logic, but it could also be due
to an imperfect representation of the same underlying
binding site. RRPE (x3), on the other hand, is selected
as a constraint because its presence guarantees that
the gene will not be in this expression pattern (NOT
logic), even if x1 or x2 is present. Any genes with x3
have a zero probability of participating in this expression
pattern (green boxes in Figure 3B).
The ribosomal protein expression pattern demonstrates another example of redundancy (Figure 3C).
RAP1 is the main regulator of ribosomal proteins in
S. cerevisiae, and 90% of the 137 ribosomal protein
genes are reported to have a RAP1 binding site upstream (Lascaris et al., 1999). However, many of these
RAP1 sites deviate from the consensus binding site. At
a normalized depth (motif score) of 0.6, 81% of the
ribosomal proteins have a RAP1 binding site, but so do
273 other genes, most of which are not coexpressed
with the ribosomal protein genes. What determines
which of these RAP1 binding sites are functional? In the
first bootstrap sample, the network chooses RAP1 in

the ← orientation with the regulatory partner M213, and
finds that a second copy of RAP1 can substitute for this
regulatory partner. It was previously observed that two
RAP1 binding sites can activate transcription synergistically (Woudt et al., 1986). If a gene has RAP1 in the ←
orientation and either M213 or a second copy of RAP1,
the gene will be expressed in pattern (1) 100% of the
time, while if both M213 and a second copy of RAP1
are absent, the chances of being expressed in pattern
(1) drop to 14%. Without one RAP1 in the ← orientation,
the presence of either M213 or a second copy of RAP1
→ is insufficient to produce this expression pattern (2%
and 0%, respectively).
A second resampling (Figure 3D) finds a second regulatory partner, M230. If a gene has a RAP1 in the ←
orientation and M230, there is a 92% chance that it
will be regulated like a ribosomal protein, in expression
pattern (1). If there is only RAP1 ←, the chances of being
in expression pattern (1) drop to 29%. These results
indicate that these motifs can substitute for the second
copy of RAP1, given the proper orientation of the first
RAP1 binding site.
The distribution of correlation coefficients for the
genes selected by the predictive rule [RAP1← and (M213
or M230 or a second copy of RAP1)] is shown in Figure

4D. Also shown is the distribution for an equally strong
RAP1 →. These rules are clearly able to distinguish a
set of genes that are tightly expressed in pattern (1).
Examples of genes that are selected by these rules are
shown in Figure 4E: all are ribosomal proteins. Examples
of genes which have an equally strong RAP1 binding
site, but in the → orientation, are shown in Figure 4F.
These genes are known to be involved in other processes, and do not participate in expression pattern (1).
Many of the motifs chosen by the network closely
match one of roughly 20 known regulatory elements,
and citations to the experimental support are included
in the Supplemental Data (available on Cell website).
But the subtle differences appear to be significant for
prediction, since our motifs learned by Gibbs sampling
and optimization were selected over the known motif
set by a substantial margin. More examples of learned
regulatory rules for other expression patterns are described in Supplemental Data, Supplemental Figure S2
available on Cell website. A list of the most frequently
learned motifs is shown in Supplemental Data, Supplemental Table S1 available on Cell website.
The types of constraints learned by the network indicate the prevalence of various modes of combinatorial
regulation in S. cerevisiae (see Supplemental Data avail-

degree of combinatorial regulation uncovered here represents a lower limit, and a broader sampling of physiological conditions may yield a higher average number
of regulators per gene and perhaps more complex rules.
Predicting Gene Expression Patterns
from Sequence
Postgenome biology is largely defined by the challenge
of mapping genetic information to phenotype. Because
of its direct physical coupling to the gene, mRNA expression dynamics provides the most proximal “phenotype”
for addressing this challenge. In this context, predictive
accuracy is the objective arbiter of how well we understand this process. The more accurate our predictions
are, the more likely our model is capturing the essential
underlying mechanisms. To this end, we assess the network’s ability to predict expression patterns of genes
from sequences which it had not seen before (the 20%
test set). We infer rules using the 80% training set genes,
and then predict the expression pattern of the reserved

test set genes by only looking at their promoter sequences. We repeat this for each of the five test sets.
Even small noise levels in the expression data would
make it impossible to predict a gene’s expression pattern exactly, so we must incorporate a reasonable
amount of flexibility in our assessment of what qualifies
as a correct prediction. We do so by predicting a gene’s
participation in one of the 49 expression patterns described above. Thus to be correctly predicted, a gene
must be predicted to be participating in the expression
pattern to which it is closest. The correlation coefficient
cut-off (C ⬎ 0.65) used to define these expression patterns seems appropriate given the measurement noise,
and the strong functional enrichments we found in Table
1. A complication is that some of these expression patterns are very similar or overlapping, e.g., expression
patterns (2) and (3) or (47) and (48) shown in Figure 1A.
Thus to avoid penalizing for prediction in a very close
expression pattern, we consider a prediction in an overlapping expression pattern correct. Overlapping expression patterns are defined to have correlation between

Mapping Sequence to Gene Expression

Figure 5. Statistical Significance of 73% Prediction Accuracy
(A) Because some of our 49 expression patterns are similar, we
consider prediction in an overlapping pattern (red) correct, but prediction in a nonoverlapping pattern (blue) is incorrect. Overlapping
patterns must have mean expression patterns which are correlated
better than C ⬎ 0.65, the radius of each pattern.
(B) 100,000 independent random assignments of all genes to expression patterns always get near 26.6% correct. The distribution is
close to normal and has a standard deviation of 1.9%, so the P-value
for our prediction of 73%, 24 standard deviations from the mean,
is P ⬍ 10⫺127.

their mean expression greater than 0.65, the same as
the cut-off defining the radius of an expression pattern,
as shown schematically in Figure 5A. Prediction in an
overlapping expression pattern most frequently occurs
when (perhaps because of noise) a gene is assigned to
a neighboring expression pattern but is actually successfully predicted using rules learned in a different, but
very similar, expression pattern.
We correctly predict the expression patterns of 73%,
or 1898 of the 2587 clustered genes in the five test sets,
as shown in Table 1. Each gene is in four crossfold
validation training sets (these are averaged) but only one
test set (these are combined). This degree of accuracy is
highly significant. If no expression patterns overlapped
we would expect to predict correctly 1/49 or approximately 2% of the time. Because there is significant overlap of some expression patterns, randomly assigning
genes to expression patterns gives 26.6% ⫾ 1.9% correct on average. The distribution of 100,000 independent
random assignments for all genes is shown in Figure 5B.
Since these independent random samples are normally
distributed to a good approximation, the P-value for our
prediction of 73% is ⬍10⫺127.
Another measure of our ability to predict gene expression, which does not have complications due to overlapping expression patterns, is the distribution of correlation coefficients of each gene to its predicted expression
pattern, as shown in Figure 6A. Three distributions are
shown, comparing full networks, networks that are constrained to use only single motifs, and random assign-

ment to expression patterns. Using only single motifs,
with the optimal depth cut-off, the mean correlation of
each gene to its predicted expression pattern is 0.36.
With full networks the average number of parent nodes
(selected motif elements or constraints) is 2.8, and the
mean correlation of each gene to its predicted expression pattern is 0.51. While the percent of genes correctly
assigned to an expression pattern increases from 26.6%
to 73% using our full network, the average correlation
of the genes to their predicted expression pattern increases dramatically, from 0.02 to 0.51. This increased
correlation is a global measure of the degree to which
we can predict gene expression, and the dramatic shift
of the curve to higher correlation demonstrates that our
global predictive accuracy approaches that detailed
above for the specific examples shown for PAC/RRPE
and RAP1 in Figure 4. The increase from single parents
to full networks also indicates the significant degree of
combinatorial regulation. Without resampling, the mean
correlation is only 0.42. That resampling improves the
results is primarily indicative of redundant modes of
regulation: each resampling can learn different ways of
regulating a particular expression pattern. For comparison, we have also tried multiple linear regression (Bussemaker et al., 2001) with our full motif set, and find that
it performs somewhat worse than single motifs (mean
correlation of 0.25), likely due to overfitting.
To provide a visual demonstration of our predictive
accuracy, we compare the actual expression profiles of
genes in one test set to the model’s prediction based
solely on sequence (Figure 6B). The actual expression
profile of the test set was hierarchically clustered (Eisen
et al., 1998), and our predicted expression profile for
each gene is displayed in the same order. As can be
seen, except for the ⵑ27% of genes which we fail to
predict correctly, there is impressive global concordance between the two sets of profiles. These predictions are somewhat “coarse-grained,” presenting us
with the challenge of extracting increasingly subtle features from future refinements of our model.
Application to Caenorhabditis elegans
S. cerevisiae provides a suitable test of our algorithm
in an organism where much is known about gene regulation and where there is an abundance of high quality
expression data. However, we are also interested in the
applicability of our approach to multicellular organisms.
As a preliminary test, we applied our algorithm to Affymetrix expression data collected during embryonic and
later development in C. elegans (Baugh et al., 2003; Hill
et al., 2000). The combined dataset contains 20 points
in a time course from staged embryos: 1 oocyte sample,
13 embryonic samples, 5 larval samples, and 1 adult
sample. We used 2000 bp of 5⬘ upstream regulatory
sequence for each gene that was expressed significantly
in this dataset (5547 genes in 30 expression patterns).
Given the larger regulatory DNA sequences, the potentially more complex regulation, and the tissue dependent expression of many genes, we were surprised to
find that we could predict the expression patterns of
roughly half of these genes. In this initial study, we have
not looked for regulatory elements in introns or downstream regions. We have also ignored the effect of oper-

ons and alternative splicing. In addition, gene architecture predictions are less well established in C. elegans
compared to S. cerevisiae. All of these effects could
change the relevant regulatory regions for some genes
and including them should improve our predictive accuracy.
Comparatively little is known about transcription factor binding sites in C. elegans. Figure 7 shows the expression profiles for four of these expression patterns
and the regulatory programs responsible for their expression. Expression patterns (4), (15), and (28), are
strongly enriched for TFs (genes in the gene ontology
classification “DNA dependent regulation of transcription”) with Bonferroni corrected P-values of 9.3 ⫻ 10⫺18,
3.6 ⫻ 10⫺17, and 3.9 ⫻ 10⫺6, respectively. Expression
patterns (4), (15), and (28) peak in the late, middle, and

early phases of embryonic development, respectively.
Expression pattern (23) is enriched for genes involved
in cell motility (P ⬍ 3.2 ⫻ 10⫺25), and peaks during larval
phases of development. Genes whose promoters satisfy
the inferred combinatorial rules recapitulate the phased
temporal expression of the original patterns, as shown
by the dashed lines in Figure 7G. Expression pattern
(28) is found to be regulated by three motifs: M320,
M324, and M323. The constraints governing the function
of these motifs include AND and OR logic, and spatial
constraints, as shown in Figure 7A. Motif M324 selects
coregulated genes by itself if it is within 180 bp of ATG.
M320 is functional only in combination with either M323,
or M324, with the positional constraint that M320 and
M324 must be within 160 bp of each other. The 83 genes

160 bp of each other)] are highly correlated, and their
expression peaks in early embryonic development, as
shown in Figure 7G. Among the genes selected by this
constraint are the known transcription factors med-1,
med-2, unc-30, fkh-3, fhk-4, and tbx-38, and their regulatory regions are shown in Figure 7E. The genes med-1
and med-2 have been shown (Maduro et al., 2001) to
be regulated by the maternal transcription factor SKN-1
(Bowerman et al., 1992), which spatially restricts their
expression to EMS. Motif M324 selects two sites 15 bp
and 43 bp upstream of the SKN-1 consensus sites
(An and Blackwell, 2003; Blackwell et al., 1994) in med-1
and med-2. These sites are within the 180 bp fragment
shown to be sufficient for proper expression of med-1
and med-2 (Maduro et al., 2001), and may contribute to
the proper temporal regulation of these genes.
Expression pattern (15) is regulated by the rule [(M91
within 280 bp of ATG) or (M87) or (M88)], as shown in
Figure 7B, which selects 202 genes. At the learned

elegans, and has strong similarity to a motif found to
be overrepresented in the 5⬘ regulatory region of four
histone genes (Roberts et al., 1989), but which has not
previously been shown to be predictive of their expression. Examples of histone genes which are selected by
this motif are shown in Supplemental Data, Supplemental Figure S3 available on Cell website. Expression pattern (4) is regulated by the rule [(M437) or (M435 and
M142)], as shown in Figure 7C, which selects 226 genes.
Expression pattern (23) is regulated by [M217 or M229],
as shown Figure 7D, which selects 162 genes (M221
provides mild improvement). This rule selects 55% of
the 47 major sperm protein genes (msp), responsible
for the amoeboid locomotion of sperm cells (L’Hernault,
1997). M217 is close to a sequence found to be overrepresented in 10 msp genes (Klass et al., 1988), but which
again has not been tested for its effect on expression.
Examples of genes selected by these motifs are shown
in Figure 7F. Figure 7G shows the actual expression
patterns (solid) and the predicted expression patterns

able to find sequence constraints that are predictive of
proper expression during development.

The examples detailed above highlight the key discoveries of our approach. First, we find a great deal of redundancy in the modes of transcriptional regulation (OR
logic). Second, many factors require at least one partner
to be functional (AND logic). Third, one mode of combinatorial regulation is the absence of a factor that would
cause a different mode of regulation (NOT logic). Finally,
we can now account for a large fraction of the information required for the proper expression of genes in response to relevant physiological perturbations and developmental dynamics in the two model organisms. The
fact that this information resides within their 5⬘ upstream
regions provides a global statistical proof for this important dogma in molecular biology.
However, whether all the requisite information is resident in the local DNA, is an open question. Because
of the statistical nature of our approach, we cannot
correctly predict all genes. Higher-order combinatorial
interactions may be difficult to learn, because they have
few, or unique instances in the genome. Also, we may
not be finding all of the relevant sequence features.
Some relevant features may be downstream or within
coding regions, or may be undetectable by standard
motif finding algorithms. The proper description of some
DNA regulatory elements may require nonadditive effects not included in our present position weight matrix
description. Another potential limitation is that our heuristic learning algorithm may not be finding the optimal
network. Finally, noise in the expression data may set
a hard limit on our ability to learn the relevant sequence
features and network structure.
But other failures may imply the existence of alternative regulatory mechanisms, e.g., because we learn the
regulatory programs from local sequence, our failures
may indicate genes where longer range interactions are
important. A prominent cause of this type of failure may
be silencing due to large scale chromatin modification
near telomeres (Gottschling et al., 1990) and mating loci
(Aparicio et al., 1991), boundary elements which inhibit
local DNA sequences from signaling nearby genes (Kellum and Schedl, 1991), or similar mechanisms which set
up chromosomal domains of gene expression (Cohen
et al., 2000). The fact that our failures are not spatially
clustered more than would be randomly expected indicates that such chromatin domains, if responsible for
our failures, appear to be of intermediate scale. What
is the role of local chromatin modifications? Are all such
modifications subservient to the local sequence features that recruit transcription factors, which in turn recruit chromatin modifying machinery? These are important questions to address in future work, and we are
currently in the process of exploring these possibilities.
Unlike the genetic code, the cis-regulatory code is
not universal, requiring for individual genes, heroic experimental efforts to elucidate (Davidson et al., 2003).
We have developed a whole-genome computational
framework for the systematic extraction of this combinatorial code and prediction of gene expression patterns

from DNA sequence alone. The large number of combinatorial rules which pass our predictive validation criterion, provide the community with a rich source of highyield hypotheses for experimental analysis. Our success
with C. elegans indicates that our general approach is
applicable to multicellular eukaryotes, but the larger regulatory regions in these genomes still present a significant challenge. Also, combinatorial regulation is likely
to be much more elaborate. In this setting, successful
motif detection and predictive modeling will undoubtedly benefit from cross-species comparisons of regulatory regions.
The results presented here clearly demonstrate that
a sufficiently general and systematic whole-genome approach is able to infer predictive regulatory constraints
from mRNA expression data and DNA sequence alone.
Our ability to decipher more complex regulatory programs is currently limited by the availability of gene
expression data. From physiological perturbations and
temporal expression responses at the organismal level,
we have identified the regulatory information in many
previously uncharacterized genes in S. cerevisiae and
C. elegans. With the increasing availability of high quality
tissue specific expression data in model organisms (Kim
et al., 2001) and humans, our method presents a framework for rapidly elucidating the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that orchestrate diverse spatiotemporal processes in multicellular organisms.
Experimental Procedures
Clustering
Our modified k-means clustering uses the standard algorithm (Hartigan, 1975), except that we constrain expression patterns to only
include genes within some cut-off Pearson correlation coefficient,
C, and we require each expression pattern to have 10 or more genes.
Any expression pattern that does not satisfy the size constraint is
reseeded from a random gene. With these constraints we choose
the maximum number of expression patterns for which this algorithm
converges. We have tried correlation cut-offs of C ⫽ 0.6, 0.65, and
0.7. At lower values of C more genes participate, but the expression patterns are less coherent. At C ⫽ 0.65, we find 49 expression
patterns of 2587 genes, and we focus on this value. Expression
patterns are considered overlapping if the correlation coefficient of
their mean expression patterns is greater than this cut-off.
Motif Finding
We use AlignACE (Hughes et al., 2000; Roth et al., 1998; Tavazoie
et al., 1999) with 12 bp motifs, and search up to 800 bp upstream
of each gene. For S. cerevisiae, this yields a large set of motifs
(ⵑ2000) with significant redundancy. We reduce the overlap in this
set by allowing no two motifs to score 50% of the same sites with
a normalized score ⬎0.5, which reduces the set to 615 motifs. We
augment this set with 51 known and experimentally documented
TF binding sites (Hughes et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2002). Each motif
is represented by a position weight matrix (PWM) and is graphically
represented using sequence logos (Schneider and Stephens, 1990).
The ability of each of these motifs to distinguish genes in the expression pattern from those not in the expression pattern can be measured with a Bayesian score, P(N|D), given below, where in this case
the network consists of single motifs as parent nodes. Using MonteCarlo simulated annealing (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983), we further optimize the AlignACE motifs by perturbing columns of each PWM to
maximize P(N|D). Text files with the motifs, PWMs, their occurrences
in genes, the expression data, and all expression patterns can be
found in the Supplemental Data available on Cell website and at
http://genomics.princeton.edu/tavazoie/Supplementary%
20Data.htm.

Learning the Structure and Probability Distributions
of the Bayesian Network
We incrementally add sequence constraints (parent nodes) which
maximize the probability that our network is correct, given the data,
using: P(N|D) ⫽ P(N)P(D|N)/P(D). The probability of the data, D,
given our network, N, assuming a Dirichlet prior is given by Cooper
and Herskovits (1992), leading to:
n

P(N | D) ⫽ P(N)

q

兿兿

i⫽1 j⫽1

⌫(aij)
⌫(aij ⫹ Nij)

ri

兿

k⫽0

⌫(aijk ⫹ Nijk)
⌫(aijk)

(1)

where ⌫(.) is the Gamma function, aij ⫽ ⌺aijk, Nij ⫽ ⌺Nijk, n is the
number of nodes with inputs in the network, ri ⫹ 1 is the number
of possible discrete states of node xi, and q is the number of possible
states of the parents of node xi. Nijk is simply the number of samples
in the database where node xi was in state k, when the parents of
xi were in state j. Each expression pattern is represented by a binary
one layer network, where n ⫽ 1 and ri ⫽ 1. Because our sequence
variables are clearly distinguishable from the expression pattern
variables ei, we use the uninformative prior (Cooper and Herskovits,
1992) aijk ⫽ 1, rather than Heckerman’s prescription from network
equivalence (Heckerman et al., 1995).
For the probability of a given network P(N), Cooper and Herskovits
assumed that all networks were equally likely. We prefer to penalize
dense networks using the method of Heckerman et al. (1995), which
gives asymptotically the same penalty as MDL (Risannen, 1989) and
other approaches (Friedman and Goldszmidt, 1998; Friedman and
Koller, 2003). Heckerman penalizes each edge of the graph which
changes relative to a reference prior network. We choose an empty
prior network, so P(N) ⬀ K⫺NP, where Np is the number of parent
nodes in the network. A parameter of our learning procedure, log(K ),
specifies how strongly complexity is penalized.
We learn network structure iteratively. First, each motif is scored
at each depth, and the highest scoring motif is added with the
optimal depth. Second, additional constraints are tested on each
existing parent: a new depth, distance to ATG in 20 bp increments,
orientation, or the presence of a second copy. Third, additional
constraints between existing parents are tested: distance between
any two motifs in 20 bp increments and their order relative to ATG.
Because more complex networks are penalized, the deletion of each
current parent constraint is also tested. Then the cycle repeats,
and stops when no structural modification improves the score. The
algorithm is relatively fast: overnight on eight 2.4 GHz processors
of a Linux cluster for S. cerevisiae.

Network Complexity and Overfitting
We varied the network complexity penalty parameter log(K ) to maximize the performance on the test dataset. As log(K ) decreases,
the networks grow larger, and the average number of parents per
network increases. Initially this increase in complexity reflects actual
combinatorial regulation, and the performance on the test set increases. But as log(K ) is decreased further, the performance on the
training set continues to improve, but the performance on the test
set declines slightly. These more complex networks overfit the training data. Optimal performance was observed at log(K ) ⫽ 15, with
an average network size of 2.8 parent nodes (motif constraints).

Linear Regression
An alternative to our approach is to model the expression data as
a linear superposition (Bussemaker et al., 2001) where the log ratio
expression level of gene i, under condition j, Eij, is given by:
Eij ⫽

兺k MikWkj,

(2)

where Mik is the number of times motif k occurs in gene i, and Wkj
is the weight with which motif k contributes to the expression level
under condition j. Wkj can be positive (for activation) or negative (for
repression). The weights Wkj are found by least-squares regression
on the 80% training set, and performance is evaluated on the 20%
test set.
