# LibraryOfBabel

The Library of Babel is a permutation of every possible combination of characters as words, on every possible combination of pages, in every possible combination of 410 page books. Currently, any useful data is drowned out by nonsensical words acting as "noise." We are proposing potential objectives, depending on the feasibility of of initial mathematical investigation: either a functional implementation of the Library of Babel or a tool for effective and concise data parsing to make the current Library of Babel more navigable and usable.
